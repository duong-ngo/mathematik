\chapter*{Conventions}

In this note, I aim to provide a comprehensive and constructive approach to mathematical analysis, which means I will not leave any proofs as exercises to readers and I will restrict the use of proof by contradiction to prove the existence of an object. However, this approach would be really verbose, and it can even be tedious because of my dry writing style.

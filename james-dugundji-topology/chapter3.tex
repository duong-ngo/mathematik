\begin{problem}{III.1.1}\label{problem:III.1.1}
\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)},leftmargin=*]
	\item Let \( X \) be an infinite set. Show that \( \mathscr{A}_{0} = \left\{ \varnothing \right\} \cup \left\{ A \mid \mathscr{C}A \text{ is finite} \right\} \) is a topology.
	\item Let \( \aleph(X) \ge \aleph_{0} \). Show that \( \mathscr{A}_{1} = \left\{ \varnothing \right\} \cup \left\{ A \mid \aleph(\mathscr{C}A) < \aleph(X) \right\} \) is a topology.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\( \mathscr{A}_{0} \) is called the cofinite topology on \( X \).

\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)},leftmargin=*]
		\item \( \varnothing \in \mathscr{A}_{0} \) and \( \mathscr{C}X = \varnothing \) is finite so \( \mathscr{A}_{0} \) contains \( \varnothing \) and \( X \).

		      Assume that \( {(A_{\alpha})}_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \) is a family of elements of \( \mathscr{A}_{0} \). According to the De Morgan's laws
		      \begin{align*}
			      \mathscr{C}\left( \bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} A_{\alpha} \right) = \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha}
		      \end{align*}

		      If there exists \( \alpha \in \mathscr{A} \) such that \( \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha} \) is finite, then \( \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha} \) is finite for being a subset of \( \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha} \). Otherwise, \( \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha} = \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} X = X \). In either case, it is true that \( \bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} A_{\alpha} \in \mathscr{A}_{0} \).

		      Moreover, if \( \mathscr{A} \) is finite then
		      \begin{align*}
			      \mathscr{C}\left( \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} A_{\alpha} \right) = \bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha}
		      \end{align*}

		      If there exists \( \alpha \in \mathscr{A} \) such that \( A_{\alpha} = \varnothing \) then \( \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} A_{\alpha} = \varnothing \in \mathscr{A}_{0} \). Otherwise, \( \mathscr{A} \) is finite and each \( \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha} \) is finite, so their union is also finite, which implies that \( \bigcup_{\alpha\in}\mathscr{C}A_{\alpha} \) is finite. In either case, it is true that \( \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} A_{\alpha} \in \mathscr{A}_{0} \) for any finite \( \mathscr{A} \).

		      Thus \( \mathscr{A}_{0} \) is a topology.
		\item \( \varnothing \in \mathscr{A}_{1} \) and \( \mathscr{C}X = \varnothing \) so \( \mathscr{A}_{1} \) contains \( \varnothing \) and \( X \).

		      Assume that \( {(A_{\alpha})}_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \) is a family of elements of \( \mathscr{A}_{1} \). According to the De Morgan's laws
		      \begin{align*}
			      \mathscr{C}\left( \bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} A_{\alpha} \right) = \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha}
		      \end{align*}

		      If there exists \( \alpha \in \mathscr{A} \) such that \( \aleph(\mathscr{C}A_{\alpha}) < \aleph(X) \), then \( \aleph\left(\bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha}\right) \le \aleph(\mathscr{C}A_{\alpha}) < \aleph(X) \). Otherwise, \( \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha} = \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} X = X \). In either case, it is true that \( \bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} A_{\alpha} \in \mathscr{A}_{1} \).

		      Moreover, if \( \mathscr{A} \) is finite then
		      \begin{align*}
			      \mathscr{C}\left( \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} A_{\alpha} \right) = \bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha}
		      \end{align*}

		      If there exists \( \alpha \in \mathscr{A} \) such that \( A_{\alpha} = \varnothing \) then \( \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} A_{\alpha} = \varnothing \in \mathscr{A}_{1} \). Otherwise, \( \mathscr{A} \) is finite and \( \aleph(\mathscr{C}A_{\alpha}) < \aleph(X) \) for each \( \alpha \).

		      We show that if \( X \) is infinite, \( A, B \subset X \) and \( \aleph(A) < \aleph(X), \aleph(B) < \aleph(X) \) then \( \aleph(A \cup B) < \aleph(X) \). If \( A, B \) are both finite then \( \aleph(A \cup B) < \aleph_{0} < \aleph(X) \). Otherwise, \( \aleph(A \cup B) = \max\left\{\aleph(A); \aleph(B)\right\} < \aleph(X) \).

		      Using mathematical induction, one can show that \( \aleph\left( \bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha}\right) < \aleph(X) \).

		      In either case, it is true that \( \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} A_{\alpha} \in \mathscr{A}_{1} \) for any finite \( \mathscr{A} \).

		      Thus \( \mathscr{A}_{1} \) is a topology.

\begin{problem}{III.1.2}
How many distinct topologies can a set of three elements have? What is their partial ordering?
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	There are exactly 29 possible topologies on \( X = \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \).
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ b \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a, b \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ b, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a \right\}, \left\{ a, b \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ b \right\}, \left\{ a, b \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ c \right\}, \left\{ a, b \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a \right\}, \left\{ b \right\} \left\{ a, b \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a \right\}, \left\{ b, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ b \right\}, \left\{ b, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ c \right\}, \left\{ b, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ b \right\}, \left\{ c \right\} \left\{ b, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a \right\}, \left\{ a, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ b \right\}, \left\{ a, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ c \right\}, \left\{ a, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a \right\}, \left\{ c \right\}, \left\{ a, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ b \right\}, \left\{ a, b \right\}, \left\{ b, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a \right\}, \left\{ b \right\}, \left\{ a, b \right\}, \left\{ b, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ b \right\}, \left\{ c \right\}, \left\{ a, b \right\}, \left\{ b, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ c \right\}, \left\{ b, c \right\}, \left\{ a, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a \right\}, \left\{ c \right\}, \left\{ b, c \right\}, \left\{ a, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ b \right\}, \left\{ c \right\}, \left\{ b, c \right\}, \left\{ a, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a \right\}, \left\{ a, b \right\}, \left\{ a, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a \right\}, \left\{ b \right\}, \left\{ a, b \right\}, \left\{ a, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a \right\}, \left\{ c \right\}, \left\{ a, b \right\}, \left\{ a, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a \right\}, \left\{ b \right\}, \left\{ c \right\}, \left\{ a, b \right\}, \left\{ b, c \right\}, \left\{ a, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.1.3}
Let \( \mathscr{T}_{X}, \mathscr{T}_{Y} \) be topologies in \( X, Y \), respectively. Is
\[ \mathscr{T} = \left\{ A\times B \mid A \in \mathscr{T}_{X}, B \in \mathscr{T}_{Y} \right\} \]

a topology in \( X\times Y \)?
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	In general, it is not a topology in \( X\times Y \). Here is a counterexample.

	\( X = Y = \left\{ 0, 1 \right\} \) and \( \mathscr{T}_{X} = \mathscr{T}_{Y} = \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ 0 \right\}, \left\{ 1 \right\}, \left\{ 0, 1 \right\} \right\} \). Let \( A_{1} = B_{1} = \left\{ 0 \right\} \) and \( A_{2} = B_{2} = \left\{ 1 \right\} \) then \( A_{1} \times B_{1}, A_{2} \times B_{2} \in \mathscr{T} \) and \( A_{1} \times B_{1} \cup A_{2} \times B_{2} = \left\{ (0, 0), (1, 1) \right\} \), which is not a Cartesian product of any two sets as it contains \( (0, 0), (1, 1) \) but not \( (0, 1), (1, 0) \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.1.4}\label{problem:III.1.4}
Let \( X \) be a partially ordered set. Define \( U \subset X \) to be open if it satisfies the condition: \( (x \in U) \land (y \prec x) \implies y \in U \). Show that \( \left\{ U \mid U \text{ is open} \right\} \) is a topology.
\end{problem}

This is in fact an Alexandrov topology, in which the intersection of arbitrarily many open sets is open.

\begin{proof}
	Let \( \mathscr{T} = \left\{ U \mid U \text{ is open} \right\} \) then \( \varnothing, X \in \mathscr{T} \) (the first one is vacuously true).

	Assume that \( {(U_{\alpha})}_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \) is a family of open sets and denote \( U = \bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} U_{\alpha}, V = \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \).

	If \( x \in U \) and \( y \prec x \) then there exists \( \alpha \in \mathscr{A} \) such that \( x \in U_{\alpha} \). From the definition of open sets, we deduce that \( y \in U_{\alpha} \subset U \). Therefore \( U \) is open.

	If \( x \in V \) and \( y \prec x \) then from the definition of open sets, we deduce that \( y \in U_{\alpha} \subset U \) for every \( \alpha\in\mathscr{A} \). Therefore \( V \) is open.

	Thus \( \left\{ U \mid U \text{ is open} \right\} \) is a topology.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.1.5}\label{problem:III.1.5}
In \( \mathbb{Z}^{+} \), define \( U \subset \mathbb{Z}^{+} \) to be open if it satisfies the condition: \( n \in U \implies \) every divisor of \( n \) belongs to \( U \). Show that this is a topology in \( \mathbb{Z}^{+} \) and that it is not the discrete topology.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	This is a particular case of the result in Problem~\ref{problem:III.1.4} as ``is a divisor of'' is a partial ordering on \( \mathbb{Z}^{+} \).

	This is not the discrete topology as it doesn't contain the subset of the form \( \left\{ n \right\} \) where \( n > 1 \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.1.6}
Prove: \( \mathscr{T} \) is the discrete topology in \( X \) if and only if every point is an open set.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	If \( \mathscr{T} \) is the discrete topology in \( X \) then every point is an open set by the definition of discrete topology.

	Conversely, if every point is an open set then every subset \( A \) of \( X \) is a union of open set, since \( A = \bigcup_{x\in A} \left\{x\right\} \), so \( A \in \mathscr{T} \) for every subset \( A \) of \( X \). Therefore \( \mathscr{T} \) is the discrete topology in \( X \).
\end{proof}

\section{Basis for a given topology}

\section{Topologizing of sets}

\begin{problem}{III.3.1}
Use 3.2 to verify the final statement of section 1, examples 4 and 5.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	The family of open intervals in \( E^{1} \) is a basis for the Euclidean topology in \( E^{1} \).

	The family of open balls in \( E^{n} \) is a basis for the Euclidean topology in \( E^{n} \).

	We prove the latter as it is more general. Let \( \mathscr{B} \) be the collection of open balls in \( E^{n} \) and \( B(x_{1}; r_{1}), B(x_{2}; r_{2}) \in \mathscr{B} \). If \( x \in B_{1}(x_{1}; r_{1}) \cap B_{2}(x_{2}; r_{2}) \), then \( x \in B(x; r) \subset B_{1}(x_{1}; r_{1}) \cap B_{2}(x_{2}; r_{2}) \), in which \( r = \min\left\{ r_{1} - \left\vert x - x_{1} \right\vert, r_{2} - \left\vert x - x_{2} \right\vert \right\} \). Hence \( \mathscr{B} \) is a basis for some topology in \( E^{n} \). Denote this topology by \( \mathscr{T}(\mathscr{B}) \).

	According to Theorem 3.2, \( \mathscr{T}(\mathscr{B}) \) is unique and is the smallest topology containing \( \mathscr{B} \). Hence the Euclidean topology \( \mathscr{T} \) in \( E^{n} \) contains \( \mathscr{T}(\mathscr{B}) \). Moreover, if \( G \in \mathscr{T} \) then for each \( x \in G \), there exists \( r(x) > 0 \) such that \( x \in B(x; r(x)) \subset G \), from which we deduce that \( G = \bigcup_{x\in G} B(x; r(x)) \in \mathscr{T}(\mathscr{B}) \). Hence \( \mathscr{T} = \mathscr{T}(\mathscr{B}) \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.3.2}
If, in the plane, all straight lines are taken as subbasis, what is the topology?
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Since all straight lines are taken as subbasis, then the intersections of non-parallel straight lines are open, which means any point is open. Therefore the topology is the discrete topology.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.3.3}
Describe the open sets if all straight lines in the plane parallel to the \(x\)-axis are used for subbasis.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Each open set is a union of straight lines parallel to the \(x\)-axis.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.3.4}\label{problem:III.3.4}
Let \(X\) be the set of all \( (n\times n) \) matrices of real numbers. For each \( a = {(a_{ij})} \) and \( r > 0 \), let \( U_{r}(a) = \left\{ (b_{ij}) \mid \forall i, j: \left\vert a_{ij} - b_{ij} \right\vert < r \right\} \). Show that these sets are the basis for a topology in \( X \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Assume that \( a \in U_{r_{1}}(a^{1}) \cap U_{r_{2}}(a^{2}) \) then \( a \in U_{r}(a) \subset U_{r_{1}}(a^{1}) \cap U_{r_{2}}(a^{2}) \) in which
	\[
		r = \min\limits_{i, j}\left\{ r_{1} - \left\vert a_{ij} - a^{1}_{ij} \right\vert, r_{2} - \left\vert a_{ij} - a^{2}_{ij} \right\vert \right\}
	\]

	so these sets are the basis for a topology in \(X\), according to Theorem 3.2.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.3.5}\label{problem:III.3.5}
Let \(C\) be the set of all continuous real-valued functions on \( [0, 1] \). For each \( f\in C \), each finite set \( x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n} \in [0, 1] \), and \( \varepsilon > 0 \), let \( U_{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, \varepsilon)}(f) = \left\{ g \mid \left\vert g(x_{i}) - f(x_{i}) \right\vert < \varepsilon, i = 1, \ldots, n \right\} \). Show (a) that these neighborhoods form a basis for some topology \( \mathscr{L} \); (b) that \( \mathscr{L} \subsetneq \mathscr{U} \); and (c) that \( \mathscr{L} \) and \( \mathscr{M} \) are not related in the partial ordering of topologies in \( C \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
		\item Assume that \( h \in U_{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, \varepsilon)}(f) \cap U_{(y_{1}, \ldots, y_{m}, \delta)}(g) \). We define
		      \begin{multline*}
			      r = \min\Bigl\{ \varepsilon - \left\vert h(x_{1}) - f(x_{1}) \right\vert, \ldots, \varepsilon - \left\vert h(x_{n}) - f(x_{n}) \right\vert, \\
			      \delta - \left\vert h(y_{1}) - g(y_{1}) \right\vert, \ldots, \delta - \left\vert h(y_{m}) - g(y_{m}) \right\vert \Bigr\}
		      \end{multline*}

		      then \( h \in U_{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, y_{1}, \ldots, y_{m}, r)}(h) \subset U_{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, \varepsilon)}(f) \cap U_{(y_{1}, \ldots, y_{m}, \delta)}(g) \).

		      Hence the given neighborhoods form a basis for some topology \( \mathscr{L} \).
		\item Let \( U_{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, \varepsilon)}(f) \) be a basic open set of \( \mathscr{L} \) and \( g \in U_{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, \varepsilon)}(f) \) then let
		      \[
			      \delta = \min\limits_{i}\left\{ \varepsilon - \left\vert f(x_{i}) - g(x_{i}) \right\vert \right\}
		      \]

		      then \( g \in U(g, \delta) \subset U_{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, \varepsilon)}(f) \). Hence \( \mathscr{L} \subset \mathscr{U} \).

		      Choose \( f \equiv 0 \) and consider \( U(f, 1) \). Let \( g \) be an element of \( U(f, 1) \) then \( \sup\limits_{x}\left\vert f(x) - g(x) \right\vert < 1 \). Consider \( x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n} \in [0, 1] \) and \( \varepsilon > 0 \). There exists a continuous function \( h \in U_{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, \varepsilon)}(g) \) such that \( h(x_{i}) = g(x_{i}) \) for \( i = 1, \ldots, n \) and \( h(x) = 1 \) for some \( x \in [0, 1] \) other than \( x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n} \) (for example, a piecewise linear function). Hence \( h \in U_{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, \varepsilon)}(f) \) but \( h \notin U(f, 1) \), which means \( U_{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, \varepsilon)}(g) \not\subset U(f, 1) \) for every \( g \in U(f, 1) \), every finite subset \( \left\{ x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n} \right\} \subset [0, 1] \), every \( \varepsilon > 0 \). This implies that \( U(f, 1) \) doesn't contains any basic open set of \( \mathscr{L} \), which means \( \mathscr{U} \ne \mathscr{L} \).

		      Thus \( \mathscr{L} \) is strictly coarser (smaller) than \( \mathscr{U} \).
		\item Choose \( f \equiv 0 \).

		      Let \( g \in M(f, 1) \) and \( \left\{ x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n} \right\} \subset [0, 1], \varepsilon > 0 \). Without loss of generality, when \( n > 1 \), one can assume \( 0 \le x_{1} < x_{2} < \cdots < x_{n} \le 1 \). There exists a continuous function \( h \in C \) such that \( h(x_{i}) = g(x_{i}) \) for \( i = 1, \ldots, n \) and \( \int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}}\left\vert h \right\vert = \int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}}\left\vert h - f \right\vert = 1 \). When \( n = 1 \), we can choose \( h \in C \) such that \( h(x_{1}) = g(x_{1}) \) and \( \int_{x_{1}}^{1}\left\vert h \right\vert = 1 \) (if \( x_{1} \ne 1 \)) or \( \int_{0}^{x_{1}}\left\vert h \right\vert = 1 \) (if \( x_{1} = 1 \)). In either cases, \( h \in U_{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, \varepsilon)}(g) \) but \( h \notin M(f, 1) \).

		      Hence \( M(f, 1) \) doesn't contain any basic open set in \( \mathscr{L} \).

		      Let \( g \in U_{(x_{0}, 1)}(f) \) in which \( 0 < x_{0} < 1 \) and \( \varepsilon > 0 \). We define a function \( k \in C \). We can pick a real number \( \delta \) such that \( 0 < \delta < \min\left\{ \dfrac{\varepsilon}{1 + \left\vert 1 - g(x_{0}) \right\vert}, x_{0}, 1 - x_{0} \right\} \). Define \( k \in C \) as a piecewise linear function
		      \[
			      k(x) = \begin{cases}
				      0                                                      & 0 \le x < x_{0} - \delta       \\
				      \frac{1 - g(x_{0})}{\delta}(x - x_{0}) + 1 - g(x_{0})  & x_{0} - \delta \le x \le x_{0} \\
				      -\frac{1 - g(x_{0})}{\delta}(x - x_{0}) + 1 - g(x_{0}) & x_{0} \le x \le x_{0} + \delta \\
				      0                                                      & x_{0} + \delta < x \le 1
			      \end{cases}
		      \]

		      then \( \int_{0}^{1}\left\vert k \right\vert = \delta\left\vert 1 - g(x_{0}) \right\vert < \dfrac{\varepsilon}{1 + \left\vert 1 - g(x_{0})\right\vert} \cdot \left\vert 1 - g(x_{0}) \right\vert < \varepsilon \) so if we define \( h = g + k \) then \( h \in M(g, \varepsilon) \). However, \( h(x_{0}) - f(x_{0}) = h(x_{0}) = k(x_{0}) + g(x_{0}) = (1 - g(x_{0})) + g(x_{0}) = 1 \), which means \( h \notin U_{(x_{0}, 1)}(f) \).

		      So \( U_{(x_{0}, 1)}(f) \) doesn't contain any basic open set in \( \mathscr{M} \).

		      Thus \( \mathscr{L} \) and \( \mathscr{M} \) are not related in the partial ordering of topologies in \( C \).

Let \( X \) be a partially ordered set {\color{red}with at least two distinct and comparable elements}. Let \( U_{L}(x) = \{y \mid y \prec x\} \) and \( U_{R}(x) = \{y \mid x \prec y\} \). Show:

\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
		\item If \( U_{L}(x) \) and \( U_{L}(y) \) are not disjoint then there exists \( z \in U_{L}(x) \cap U_{L}(y) \). Because \( \prec \) is transitive, we deduce that \( U_{L}(z) \subset U_{L}(x) \) and \( U_{L}(z) \subset U_{L}(y) \), which implies \( U_{L}(z) \subset U_{L}(x) \cap U_{L}(y) \). Therefore \( \left\{ U_{L}(x) \right\} \) forms a basis for a topology \( \mathscr{T}_{L} \) in \( X \).

		      If \( U_{R}(x) \) and \( U_{R}(y) \) are not disjoint then there exists \( z \in U_{R}(x) \cap U_{R}(y) \). Because \( \prec \) is transitive, we deduce that \( U_{R}(z) \subset U_{R}(x) \) and \( U_{R}(z) \subset U_{R}(y) \), which implies \( U_{R}(z) \subset U_{R}(x) \cap U_{R}(y) \). Therefore \( \left\{ U_{R}(x) \right\} \) forms a basis for a topology \( \mathscr{T}_{R} \) in \( X \).
		\item If \( G \in \mathscr{T}_{L} \) then \( G \) is a union of sets of the form \( U_{L}(y) \). In other words, \( G = \bigcup_{y \in I} U_{L}(y) \). If \( x \in G \) then there exists \( y \in I \) such that \( x \in U_{L}(y) \) so \( U_{L}(x) \subset U_{L}(y) \subset G \).

		      Conversely, assume that \( x \in G \implies U_{L}(x) \subset G \) then \( G = \bigcup_{x\in G} U_{L}(x) \), which means \( G \in \mathscr{T}_{L} \) since \( \left\{ U_{L}(x) \right\} \) is a basis for \( \mathscr{T}_{L} \).
		\item Firstly, we show that the intersection of arbitrary many basic open sets in \( \mathscr{T}_{L} \) is a basic open set in \( \mathscr{T}_{L} \). Let \( S \) be a subset of \( X \) and \( U = \bigcap_{x\in S} U_{L}(x) \). If \( U \) is empty then it is open. Otherwise, for each \( y \in U \), \( U_{L}(y) \subset U_{L}(x) \) for every \( x \in S \) so for each \( y \in U \), \( U_{L}(y) \subset U \). Hence \( U \in \mathscr{T}_{L} \).
		\item Assume that \( \mathscr{T} \) is a topology on \( X \) containing both \( \mathscr{T}_{L} \) and \( \mathscr{T}_{R} \). Let \( x \) be an arbitrary element of \( X \) then \( \left\{ x \right\} = U_{L}(x) \cap U_{R}(x) \) (due to antisymmetry), which means \( \left\{ x \right\} \in \mathscr{T} \) for every \( x \in X \). Therefore \( \mathscr{T} \) is the discrete topology on \( X \). Conversely, the discrete topology on \( X \) contains both \( \mathscr{T}_{L} \) and \( \mathscr{T}_{R} \). Thus the discrete topology is the only one larger than both \( \mathscr{T}_{L} \) and \( \mathscr{L}_{R} \).
		\item Let \( a, b \) be two distinct and comparable elements of \( X \). Without loss of generality, assume that \( a \prec b \). Moreover, \( U_{L}(a) \notin \mathscr{T}_{R} \) and \( U_{R}(b) \notin \mathscr{T}_{L} \) (according to part (b)). Thus \(\mathscr{T}_{L}\) and \(\mathscr{T}_{R}\) are not related in the partial ordering of the topologies on \(X\).

\begin{problem}{III.3.7}
In \(\mathbb{Z}\), let \(p\) be a fixed prime. For each integer \(a > 0\), define \(U_{a}(n) = \{n + \lambda p^{a} \mid \lambda \in \mathbb{Z}\}\). Show that \(\{U_{a}(n)\}\) is a basis for some topology.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Assume that \( U_{a}(n) \cap U_{b}(m) \) is nonempty. Let \( x \in U_{a}(n) \cap U_{b}(m) \) then \( \lambda = \dfrac{x - n}{p^{a}} \) and \( \mu = \dfrac{x - m}{p^{b}} \) are integers. Without loss of generality, assume that \( a \le b \).

	\[ 0 = x - x = (n + \lambda p^{a}) - (m + \mu p^{b}) = (n - m) + (\lambda + \mu p^{b - a}) p^{a} \]

	so
	\[ m = n + (\lambda + \mu p^{b-a})p^{a} \in U_{a}(n) \]

	from which and \( a \le b \), we deduce that \( U_{b}(m) \subset U_{a}(n) \).

	Therefore \( U_{a}(n) \cap U_{b}(m) = U_{b}(m) \). Hence \( \left\{ U_{a}(n) \right\} \) is a basis for some topology.

Let \(\{\mathscr{T}_\alpha \mid \alpha \in \mathscr{A}\}\) be any family of topologies on \(X\). Define \(\bigvee_\alpha \mathscr{T}_\alpha\) to be the topology having \(\bigcup_\alpha \mathscr{T}_\alpha\) as subbasis.
\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]

	\item Show that with the operations \( \mathscr{T}_{1} \vee \mathscr{T}_{2} \) and \( \mathscr{T}_{1} \cap \mathscr{T}_{2} \) that the topologies on \( X \) form a complete lattice.
	\item Is \( \mathscr{T}_{1} \cap (\mathscr{T}_{2} \vee \mathscr{T}_{3}) = (\mathscr{T}_{1} \cap \mathscr{T}_{2}) \vee (\mathscr{T}_{1} \cap \mathscr{T}_{3}) \) always true?
	\item What is \( \mathscr{T}_{L} \vee \mathscr{T}_{R} \) in Problem~\ref{problem:III.3.6}?
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
		\item \(\bigvee_\alpha \mathscr{T}_\alpha\) is the topology having \(\bigcup_\alpha \mathscr{T}_\alpha\) as subbasis so it is the smallest topology containing \(\bigcup_\alpha \mathscr{T}_\alpha\).

		      Assume that \( \mathscr{T} \) is a topology larger than every \( \mathscr{T}_{\alpha} \) then every finite intersection of open sets in \( \bigcup_{\alpha}\mathscr{T}_{\alpha} \) is in \( \mathscr{T} \) hence every union of finite intersections of open sets in \( \bigcup_{\alpha} U_{\alpha} \) is in \( \mathscr{T} \). Therefore \( \bigvee_\alpha \mathscr{T}_\alpha \subset \mathscr{T} \).

		      Thus \( \bigvee_\alpha \mathscr{T}_\alpha \) is the smallest of the topologies on \(X\) larger than every \( \mathscr{T}_{\alpha} \).
		\item Let \( T \) be a collection of topologies on \( X \).

		      \( \bigcap_{\mathscr{T} \in T} \mathscr{T} \) is the largest of the topologies on \( X \) smaller than every \( \mathscr{T} \in T \).

		      \( \bigvee_{\mathscr{T} \in T} \mathscr{T} \) is the smallest of the topologies on \( X \) larger than every \( \mathscr{T} \in T \).

		      Hence \( T \) has a greatest lower bound and a least upper bound, so the topologies on \(X\) with the partial ordering by inclusion form a complete lattice.
		\item No. It is not true in general. However, \( \mathscr{T}_{1} \cap (\mathscr{T}_{2} \vee \mathscr{T}_{3}) \supset (\mathscr{T}_{1} \cap \mathscr{T}_{2}) \vee (\mathscr{T}_{1} \cap \mathscr{T}_{3}) \) always holds.

\begin{problem}{III.3.9}
In the set \(\mathbb{R}\) of all real numbers, let \( \sigma \) consist of all sets of form \( \left\{ x \mid x > r \right\} \), \( \left\{ x \mid x < r \right\} \), where \( r, s \) are rational. Show that \( \mathscr{T}(\sigma) \) is the Euclidean topology of \( \mathbb{R} \). Is this still true if \( r, s \) are restricted to be numbers of the form \( k/2^{n} \) (\(k\) and \(n\) arbitrary {\color{red}integers})?
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	The open sets in \( \mathscr{T}(\sigma) \) are the unions of finite intersections of sets of the forms \( \left\{ x \mid x > r \right\} \) and \( \left\{ x \mid x < s \right\} \) in which \( r, s \) are rational. Hence the open sets in \( \mathscr{T}(\sigma) \) are the unions of sets of the form \( \openinterval{r, s} \), \( \left\{ x \mid x > r \right\} \), \( \left\{ x \mid x < s \right\} \) in which \( r, s \) are rational. So the collection \( \mathscr{C} \) of \( \openinterval{r, s} \), \( \left\{ x \mid x > r \right\} \), \( \left\{ x \mid x < s \right\} \) in which \( r, s \) are rational is a basis for \( \mathscr{T}(\sigma) \). For each \( C \in \mathscr{C} \) and for each \( x \in C \) there are \( a, b \in \mathbb{R} \) such that \( x \in \openinterval{a, b} \subset C \).

	The collection of open intervals is a basis for the Euclidean topology of \( \mathbb{R} \). Consider an open interval \( \openinterval{a, b} \) and an arbitrary \( x \in \openinterval{a, b} \). Since there is a rational number between two distinct real numbers, there exist rational numbers \( r \in \openinterval{a, x} \) and \( s \in \openinterval{x, b} \). Hence \( x \in \openinterval{r, s} \subset \openinterval{a, b} \).

	Thus \( \mathscr{T}(\sigma) \) is the Euclidean topology of \( \mathbb{R} \).

	The only property of rational numbers that we exploit in the above proof is that every open interval contains a rational number.

	We show that if two real numbers \( a, b \) are such that \( a < b \) then there exists a rational number of the form \( \dfrac{k}{2^{n}} \) in \( \openinterval{a, b} \). There exists an integer \( n \) such that \( \dfrac{1}{2^{n}} < b - a \) so \( 2^{n}a < 2^{n}a + 1 < 2^{n}b \). Let \( k = \left\lfloor 2^{n}a \right\rfloor + 1 \) then \( 2^{n}a < k \le 2^{n}a + 1 < 2^{n}b \), which implies \( a < \dfrac{k}{2^{n}} < b \).

	Hence every open interval contains a rational numbers of the form \( k/2^{n} \) (\(k\) and \(n\) are arbitrary integers). Thus the statement still holds if \( r, s \) are restricted to be numbers of the form \( k/2^{n} \) (\(k\) and \(n\) are arbitrary integers).

\section{Elementary concepts}

\begin{problem}{III.4.1}
Determine the closure, derived set, interior, and boundary, of the following sets: (a) The rationals in \( E^{1} \); (b) the Cantor set in \(E^{1}\); (c) the set
\[
	\left\{ (r_{1}, r_{2}) \mid r_{1}, r_{2} \in \mathbb{Q} \right\} \subset E^{2};
\]

(d) \( \left\{ (x, 0) \mid 0 < x < 1 \right\} \subset E^{2} \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)},itemsep=0pt]
		\item Let \( U \) be a nonempty open set of \( E^{1} \) then \( U \) contains an interval \( \openinterval{a, b} \) where \( a < b \). Since there is a rational number \( q \in \openinterval{a, b} \), we conclude that \( U \cap \mathbb{Q} \ne \varnothing \). Therefore \( \mathbb{Q} \) is dense in \( E^{1} \), which means the closure of \( \mathbb{Q} \) in \( E^{1} \) is \( \mathbb{R} \).

		      For every \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), for every neighborhood \( U \) of \( x \), there exist \( a, b \in \mathbb{R} \) such that \( x \in \openinterval{a, b} \subset U \). The interval \( \openinterval{x, b} \subset \openinterval{a, b} \) contains a rational number and it is other than \( x \). Hence \( x \) is in the derived set of \( \mathbb{Q} \) in \( E^{1} \). Therefore the derived set of \( \mathbb{Q} \) in \( E^{1} \) is \( \mathbb{R} \).

		      Let \( r \in \mathbb{Q} \). For every neighborhood \( U \) of \( r \), there exist \( a, b \in \mathbb{R} \) such that \( r \in \openinterval{a, b} \subset U \). However, \( \openinterval{a, b} \) intersects both \( \mathbb{Q} \) and \( \mathbb{R} - \mathbb{Q} \), which means \( \mathbb{Q} \) has empty interior. This implies that \( \mathbb{R} - \mathbb{Q} \) is dense in \( E^{1} \).

		      The boundary of \( \mathbb{Q} \) is \( E^{1} \) is \( \overline{\mathbb{Q}} \cap \overline{\mathscr{C}\mathbb{Q}} = \overline{\mathbb{Q}} \cap \overline{\mathbb{R} - \mathbb{Q}} = \mathbb{R} \cap \mathbb{R} = \mathbb{R} \).
		\item We repeat the definition of the Cantor set.

		      Starting with \( \closedinterval{0, 1} \), we remove the middle-third open interval \( M_{1} = \openinterval{\frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}} \).

		      Then we remove the middle-third open intervals from the remaining intervals \( \closedinterval{0, \frac{1}{3}} \) and \( \closedinterval{\frac{2}{3}, 1} \).

		      At the \( n \)-th stage, we remove the union \( M_{n} \) of the middle thirds of the remaining \( 2^{n-1} \) intervals.

		      The Cantor set is \( C = \closedinterval{0, 1} - \bigcup^{\infty}_{1} M_{n} \).

		      Since each \( M_{n} \) is open in \( E^{1} \), it follows that \( \bigcup^{\infty}_{1} M_{n} \) is open in \( E^{1} \), so \( C \) is closed in \( E^{1} \), which means the closure of \( C \) in \( E^{1} \) is \( C \).

		      Because \( C \) is closed in \( E^{1} \), the derived set of \( C \) is contained in \( C \). We will show that every point of \( C \) is a cluster point of \( C \). Let \( x \in C \) and \( U \) be a neighborhood of \(x\). There exists an open interval \( \openinterval{a, b} \) such that \( x \in \openinterval{a, b} \subset U \).
		      \[ C = \closedinterval{0, 1} - \bigcup^{\infty}_{1} M_{n} = \bigcap^{\infty}_{1}\left( \closedinterval{0, 1} - M_{n} \right) \]

		      For each \( n \), there exists a closed interval \( I_{n} \) in \( \closedinterval{0, 1} - M_{n} \) containing \( x \). We can choose a sufficiently large number \( n \) such that the length of \( I_{n} \) is less than \( x - a \) and \( b - x \). Hence \( x \in I_{n} \subset \openinterval{a, b} \). The endpoints of \( I_{n} \) are in \( C \) and other than \( x \) so \( \openinterval{a, b} \cap (C - \left\{x\right\}) \ne \varnothing \). Hence \( x \) is a cluster point of \( C \).

		      Thus the derived set of \( C \) is \( C \) itself.

		      Let \( x \) be a point in \( C \) and \( U \) a neighborhood of \( x \). Since \( U \) is open, there exists an open interval \( \openinterval{a, b} \) such that \( x \in \openinterval{a, b} \subset U \). The total length of closed intervals in \( \closedinterval{0, 1} - M_{n} \) is \( {(2/3)}^{n} \) and can be arbitrarily small, so there exists \( n \) such that \( {(2/3)}^{n} < b - a \), which implies \( \openinterval{a, b} \not\subset \closedinterval{0, 1} - M_{n} \) so \( \openinterval{a, b} \) is not contained in the Cantor set. Therefore \( C \) has empty interior.

		      The boundary of \( C \) is the complement of the interior of \( C \) in the closure of \( C \), so the boundary of \(C\) is \(C\) itself.
		\item The given set is dense in \( E^{2} \) so its closure is \( \mathbb{R}^{2} \).

		      Every point of \( E^{2} \) is a cluster point of the given set so its derived set is \( E^{2} \).

		      The interior of the given set is empty.

		      The boundary of the given set is \( \mathbb{R}^{2} \).
		\item The closure of the given set is \( \left\{ (x, 0) \mid 0 \le x \le 1 \right\} \).

		      The derived set of the given set is \( \left\{ (x, 0) \mid 0 \le x \le 1 \right\} \).

		      The interior of the given set is empty.

		      The boundary of the given set is \( \left\{ (x, 0) \mid 0 \le x \le 1 \right\} \).

Show that \( E^{s} \times 0 \subset E^{s} \times E^{t} = E^{s+t} \) is closed.

\begin{proof}
	Let \( x \in E^{s+t} - (E^{s}\times 0) \) and \( y \) be the orthogonal projection of \( x \) on \( E^{s} \times 0 \), then
	\[
		x \in B(x; \left\vert x - y \right\vert) \subset E^{s+t} - (E^{s}\times 0)
	\]

	which implies that \( E^{s+t} - (E^{s}\times 0) \) is open in \( E^{s+t} \). Hence \( E^{s}\times 0 \) is closed in \( E^{s+t} \).

Let \( A \subset E^{1} \) be a bounded set. Show \( \sup A \in \overline{A} \). Under what condition is \( \sup A \in A^{\prime} \)\@?
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	From the definition of supremum, any real number strictly less than \( \sup A \) is not an upper bound of \( A \). Let \( U \) be a neighborhood of \( \sup A \) then there exists an open interval \( \openinterval{a, b} \) such that \( \sup A \in \openinterval{a, b} \subset U \). Since \( a < \sup A \) then there exists \( x \in A \) such that \( a < x \), from which we deduce that \( a < x \le \sup A < b \). Hence \( U \cap A \ne \varnothing \), which means \( \sup A \in \overline{A} \).

	\( \sup A \in A^{\prime} \) if and only if for every \( x < \sup A \), there exists \( y \in A \) such that \( x < y < \sup A \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.4.4}
Prove: \(G\) is open in \(X\) if and only if \( \overline{G \cap \overline{A}} = \overline{G \cap A} \) for every \( A \subset X \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\( G \) is open in \(X\) \( \implies \) \( \overline{G \cap \overline{A}} = \overline{G \cap A} \) for every \( A \subset X \).

	\( G \cap A \subset G \cap \overline{A} \) implies \( \overline{G \cap A} \subset \overline{G \cap \overline{A}} \). Assume that there exists \( x \in \overline{G \cap \overline{A}} \) such that \( x \notin \overline{G \cap A} \) then there is a neighborhood \(V\) of \(x\) such that \( V \cap (G \cap \overline{A}) \ne \varnothing \) and \( V \cap (G \cap \overline{A}) = \varnothing \). This is a contradiction, as any open set that intersects \( \overline{A} \) must intersects \( A \). Hence \( \overline{G \cap \overline{A}} = \overline{G \cap A} \).

	\( \overline{G \cap \overline{A}} = \overline{G \cap A} \) for every \( A \subset X \) \( \implies \)  \( G \) is open in \(X\).

	Choose \( A = \mathscr{C}G \) then \( \overline{G \cap \overline{\mathscr{C}G}} = \overline{G \cap (\mathscr{C}G)} = \overline{\varnothing} = \varnothing \). Therefore \( G \cap \overline{\mathscr{C}G} = \varnothing \). Moreover, \( \mathscr{C}\overline{\mathscr{C}G} = \operatorname{Int} G \) so \( G \subset \operatorname{Int} G \) and it follows from the definition of interior that \( G = \operatorname{Int} G \). Hence \( G \) is open in \( X \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.4.5}
Show that \( (A^{\prime} = \varnothing) \implies (A \text{ is closed}) \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Since \( \overline{A} = A \cup A^{\prime} \) it follows that \( A^{\prime} = \varnothing \) implies \( \overline{A} = A \), which means \( A \) is closed.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.4.6}
Let \(A = \left\{ 1/m + 1/n \mid m, n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \right\} \subset E^{1} \). Show that \( A^{\prime} = \left\{ 1/n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \right\} \cup \left\{ 0 \right\} \), \( A^{\prime\prime} = \left\{0\right\} \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Every number in \( \left\{ 1/n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \right\} \cup \left\{0\right\} \) is a cluster point of \(A\).

	Let \(x\) be a real number such that there is no positive integer \(n\) such that \( x = \dfrac{1}{n} \). If \( x < 0 \) or \( x \ge 2 \), \( x \) is not a cluster point of \(A\). Consider \( x \in \openinterval{0, 2} \).

	Let \(p\) be the largest positive integer such that \( x < \dfrac{1}{p} \) then \( \dfrac{1}{p+1} < x < \dfrac{1}{p} \). Hence there exists \( \varepsilon > 0 \) such that \( \openinterval{x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon} \) doesn't contain any rational number of the form \( \dfrac{1}{q} \).

	We will show that \( \openinterval{x - \varepsilon/2, x + \varepsilon/2} \) has at most finitely many numbers of the form \( 1/m + 1/n \) in which \( m \le n \). Assume that \( \dfrac{1}{m} + \dfrac{1}{n} \in \openinterval{x - \varepsilon/2, x + \varepsilon/2} \). Because \( \openinterval{x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon} \) has no rational number of the form \(1/a\), then
	\[ \dfrac{1}{n} \le \dfrac{1}{m} \le x - \varepsilon \]

	and
	\[ 0 < x - \dfrac{\varepsilon}{2} < \dfrac{1}{m} + \dfrac{1}{n} \le \dfrac{2}{m} \]

	Moreover
	\[
		x - \dfrac{\varepsilon}{2} < \dfrac{1}{m} + \dfrac{1}{n} < x - \varepsilon + \dfrac{1}{n}
	\]

	which implies \( n < \dfrac{2}{\varepsilon} \).

	Hence \( m < \dfrac{2}{x - \dfrac{\varepsilon}{2}} \) and \( n < \dfrac{2}{\varepsilon} \), which means there are at most finitely many rational numbers of the form \( 1/m + 1/n \) in \( \openinterval{x - \dfrac{\varepsilon}{2}, x + \dfrac{\varepsilon}{2}} \). Hence \( x \) is not a cluster point of \(A\), thus \( A^{\prime} = \left\{ 1/n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \right\} \cup \left\{0\right\} \).

	The only cluster point of \(A^{\prime}\) is 0 so \( A^{\prime\prime} = \left\{0\right\} \).

\begin{problem}{III.4.7}
Let \( \left\{ A_{\alpha} \mid \alpha \in \mathscr{A} \right\} \) be any family of sets in \(X\). Assume that \( \bigcup_{\alpha} \overline{A_{\alpha}} \) is closed. Prove \( \bigcup_{\alpha} \overline{A_{\alpha}} = \overline{\bigcup_{\alpha} A_{\alpha}} \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	If \( x \in \bigcup_{\alpha} \overline{A_{\alpha}} \) then there exists \( \alpha \in \mathscr{A} \) such that \( x \in \overline{A_{\alpha}} \). From the definition of closure, every neighborhood of \(x\) intersects \( A_{\alpha} \), hence every neighborhood of \(x\) intersects \( \bigcup_{\alpha} A_{\alpha} \). Therefore \( x \in \overline{\bigcup_{\alpha} A_{\alpha}} \), so \( \bigcup_{\alpha} \overline{A_{\alpha}} \subset \overline{\bigcup_{\alpha} A_{\alpha}} \).

	On the one hand, \( \bigcup_{\alpha} A_{\alpha} \) is a subset of \( \bigcup_{\alpha} \overline{A_{\alpha}} \) and \( \overline{\bigcup_{\alpha} A_{\alpha}} \). On the other hand, \( \overline{\bigcup_{\alpha} A_{\alpha}} \) is the smallest closed set containing \( \bigcup_{\alpha} A_{\alpha} \) and \( \bigcup_{\alpha} \overline{A_{\alpha}} \) is a closed set containing \( \bigcup_{\alpha} A_{\alpha} \). Therefore \( \bigcup_{\alpha} \overline{A_{\alpha}} = \overline{\bigcup_{\alpha} A_{\alpha}} \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.4.8}
Prove: \( \operatorname{Fr}(A) = \varnothing \) if and only if \(A\) is both open and closed.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	The complement of \( \overline{A} \) is \( \operatorname{Int}(\mathscr{C}A) \).

	\( \operatorname{Fr}(A) = \varnothing \implies A \) is both open and closed.

	From the definition of boundary, \( \varnothing = \operatorname{Fr}(A) = \overline{A} \cap \overline{\mathscr{C}A} \). On the other hand, \( \overline{A} \cup \overline{\mathscr{C}A} \supset A \cup \mathscr{C}A \) so the complement of \( \overline{A} \) is \( \overline{\mathscr{C}A} \). Hence \( \overline{\mathscr{C}A} = \operatorname{Int}(\mathscr{C}A) \) so \( \mathscr{C}A \) is both open and closed as \( \operatorname{Int}(\mathscr{C}A) \subset \mathscr{C}A \subset \overline{\mathscr{C}A} \). Therefore \(A\) is both open and closed.

	\( A \) is both open and closed \( \implies \operatorname{Fr}(A) = \varnothing \).

	Then \( \mathscr{C}A \) is both open and closed. If \( x \in A \) then there exists a neighborhood of \(x\) contained in \(A\) as \(A\) is open and this neighborhood doesn't intersect \(\mathscr{C}A\), so \( x \notin \overline{\mathscr{C}A} \). Otherwise, \( x \in \mathscr{C}A \) then there exists a neighborhood of \(x\) contained in \(\mathscr{C}A\) as \( A \) is closed and this neighborhood doesn't intersect \(A\), so \( x \notin \overline{A} \). In either cases, \( x \notin \overline{A} \cap \overline{\mathscr{C}A} = \operatorname{Fr}(A) \). Thus \( \operatorname{Fr}(A) = \varnothing \).

		      Let \(x\) be a point of \( \operatorname{Fr}\left[\operatorname{Fr}(A)\right] \) then every neighborhood of \(x\) intersects both \( \operatorname{Fr}(A) \) and \( \mathscr{C}\left[\operatorname{Fr}(A)\right] \).

		      so every neighborhood of \(x\) intersects both \( \operatorname{Fr}\left[\operatorname{Fr}(A)\right] \) and \( \mathscr{C}\left[\operatorname{Fr}\left[\operatorname{Fr}(A)\right]\right] \). Therefore \( x \in \operatorname{Fr}\left[\operatorname{Fr}\left[\operatorname{Fr}(A)\right]\right] \).

		      Thus \( \operatorname{Fr}\left[\operatorname{Fr}\left[\operatorname{Fr}(A)\right]\right] = \operatorname{Fr}\left[\operatorname{Fr}(A)\right] \).

Because \( \operatorname{Int}(A) \) is the largest open set contained in \(A\), it follows that \( \operatorname{Int}(A - B) \cup \operatorname{Int}(B) \subset \operatorname{Int}(A) \).


		      Moreover \( A - B \) and \( B \) are disjoint, \( \operatorname{Int}(A - B) \subset A - B \) and \( \operatorname{Int}(B) \subset B \) so \( \operatorname{Int}(A - B) \) and \( \operatorname{Int}(B) \) are disjoint.

Assume that \( \operatorname{Fr}(A) \cap \operatorname{Fr}(B) = \varnothing \).

\begin{proof}
	We prove that \( \operatorname{Int}(A \cup B) = \operatorname{Int}(A) \cup \operatorname{Int}(B) \iff \operatorname{Fr}(A) \cap \operatorname{Fr}(B) \subset \operatorname{Fr}(A \cup B) \).

	\( \operatorname{Int}(A) \cup \operatorname{Int}(B) \) is an open set contained in \( A \cup B \) and \( \operatorname{Int}(A \cup B) \) is the largest open set contained in \( A \cup B \). Hence \( \operatorname{Int}(A) \cup \operatorname{Int}(B) \subset \operatorname{Int}(A \cup B) \).

	Suppose that \( \operatorname{Int}(A \cup B) = \operatorname{Int}(A) \cup \operatorname{Int}(B) \). Let \( x \in \operatorname{Fr}(A) \cap \operatorname{Fr}(B) \) then every neighborhood of \( x \) intersects \( A, B, \mathscr{C}A, \mathscr{C}B \) hence intersects \( A \cup B, \mathscr{C}\left[A \cup B\right] = \mathscr{C}A \cap \mathscr{C}B \). Therefore \( x \in \operatorname{Fr}(A \cup B) \), which means \( \operatorname{Fr}(A) \cap \operatorname{Fr}(B) \subset \operatorname{Fr}(A \cup B) \).

	Conversely, suppose that \( \operatorname{Fr}(A) \cap \operatorname{Fr}(B) \subset \operatorname{Fr}(A \cup B) \). Let \( x \in \operatorname{Int}(A \cup B) \) then \( x \in \overline{A \cup B} - \operatorname{Fr}(A \cup B) \), which means \( x \notin \operatorname{Fr}(A \cup B) \) then \( x \notin \operatorname{Fr}(A) \cap \operatorname{Fr}(B) \). Without loss of generality, assume that \( x \notin \operatorname{Fr}(A) \) then either \( x \in \operatorname{Int}(A) \) or \( x \in \operatorname{Int}(\mathscr{C}A) \).

	\endgroup

	since \( x \notin \operatorname{Fr}(A) \cup \operatorname{Fr}(B) \), we deduce that \( x \in \operatorname{Int}(A) \cup \operatorname{Int}(B) \).

	In either cases, \( x \in \operatorname{Int}(A) \cup \operatorname{Int}(B) \) so \( \operatorname{Int}(A \cup B) \subset \operatorname{Int}(A) \cup \operatorname{Int}(B) \). Hence \( \operatorname{Int}(A \cup B) = \operatorname{Int}(A) \cup \operatorname{Int}(B) \).

For what spaces \(X\) is the only dense set \(X\) itself?
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Assume that \(X\) is the only dense set in \(X\) then for every \( x \in X \), \( X - \left\{ x \right\} \) is not dense in \( X \), which means the closure of \( X - \left\{ x \right\} \) in \(X\) is \( X - \left\{x\right\} \). Therefore \( X - \left\{x\right\} \) is closed, so \( \left\{ x \right\} \) is open in \(X\) for every \(x\in X\). Hence \(X\) is a discrete space.

	Conversely, if \(X\) is a discrete space then \(X\) is the only dense set in \(X\).

Let \(E\) and \(G\) be dense in \(X\). Prove: If \(E\) and \(G\) are open, then \(E \cap G\) is also dense in \(X\).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\( E \) and \( G \) are dense open subsets of \(X\) so \( E \cap G \) is nonempty. Let \( A \) be a nonempty open subset of \( X \). Because \( E \) is dense in \( X \), \( A \cap E \) is nonempty. Moreover, \( A \cap E \) is open and \( G \) is dense so \( (A \cap E) \cap G \) is nonempty. Therefore \( A \cap (E \cap G) \) is nonempty. By the definition of dense set, we conclude that \( E \cap G \) is dense in \( X \).

	Let \( x \in \overline{G} \) then every neighborhood \(V\) of \(x\) intersects \( G \). Moreover, \( V \cap G \) is nonempty and it is open because \( V, G \) are open so \( V \cap G \) intersects \( D \) as \( D \) is dense in \( X \). Hence \( V \) intersects \( D \cap G \), which means \( x \in \overline{D \cap G} \). Therefore \( \overline{G} = \overline{D \cap G} \).

	No. It is not necessarily true. Here is a counterexample.

	\( \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{R} \).

The set \( \mathbb{Z} \) intersects every set in the given subbasis but \( \mathbb{Z} \) is not dense in \( \mathbb{R} \).

In Problem~\ref{problem:III.3.6}, what is the closure of \( \left\{ x \right\} \) in \( \mathscr{T}_{L} \)? For what points is \( \left\{ x \right\} \) a closed set? An open set?
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	The closure of \( \left\{ x \right\} \) in \( \mathscr{T}_{L} \) is the intersection of closed sets containing \( x \), hence the complement of the union of open sets not containing \(x\). Therefore the closure of \( \left\{ x \right\} \) is the complement of the union of \( U_{L}(y) \) in which \( x \notin U_{L}(y) \).

	Assume that \( \left\{ x \right\} \) is a closed set then \( \mathscr{C}(\left\{ x \right\}) \) is open. Hence for every \( y \ne x \), \( x \notin U_{L}(y) \), which means for each such \( U_{L}(y) \), for every \( z \in U_{L}(y) \), either \( z \) and \( x \) are incomparable or \( (z \prec x) \land (z \ne x) \). This means \( x \) is a maximal element of \( X \). Conversely, if \( x \) is a maximal element of \( X \) then \( \left\{ x \right\} \) is a closed set.

	\( \left\{ x \right\} \) is an open set if and only if \( \left\{ x \right\} = U_{L}(x) \), which precisely means \( x \) is a minimal element of \( X \).

\begin{problem}{III.4.16}
Assume \( (X, \mathscr{T}) \) a space with the properties: (a) The intersection of any family of open sets is open; (b) if \(x\ne y\), then there is at least one open set containing some of of \(x, y\), and not the other. Define \( x\le y \) if \( x \in \overline{\left\{y\right\}} \). Show that this is a partial ordering and that the topology \( \mathscr{T}_{R} \) (Problem~\ref{problem:III.3.6}) is precisely \( \mathscr{T} \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\( x \in \overline{\left\{ x \right\}} \) so \( x \le x \).

	If \( x \in \overline{\left\{ y \right\}} \) and \( y \in \overline{ \left\{z\right\} } \) then \( \overline{\left\{ z\right\} } \) is a closed set containing \( \left\{ y \right\} \) so \( \overline{ \left\{ y \right\} } \subset \overline{ \left\{ z \right\} } \). Therefore \( x \in \overline{ \left\{ z \right\} } \) which precisely means \( x \le z \).

	Suppose that \( x \le y \) and \( y \le x \). Assume for the sake of contradiction that \( x \ne y \) then there is a neighborhood \( U_{x} \) of \(x\) not containing \( y \) or there is a neighborhood \( U_{y} \) of \(y\) not containing \( x \). In the former case, \( x \in \operatorname{Ext}(\left\{y\right\}) \) and \( x \in \overline{ \left\{y\right\} } \). In the latter case, \( y \in \operatorname{Ext}(\left\{x\right\}) \) and \( y \in \overline{ \left\{x\right\} } \). In either cases, we obtain a contradiction. Hence \( x = y \).

	Thus \( \le \) is a partial ordering.

	\hrulefill%

	We will show that \( \mathscr{T}_{R} = \mathscr{T} \).

	Let \( G \in \mathscr{T} \) then for every \( x \in G, y \notin G \), one has \( \overline{ \left\{y\right\} } \subset \mathscr{C}(G) \) and \( x \notin \overline{ \left\{y\right\} } \), which means \( x \nleq y \), so \( y \notin U_{R}(x) \). Therefore \( \mathscr{C}(G) \subset \mathscr{C}(U_{R}(x)) \) whenever \( x \in G \), which implies \( U_{R}(x) \subset G \) whenever \( x \in G \).

	Let \( N(x) \) be the intersection of all neighborhoods of \(X\) then \( N(x) \) is open as the intersection of any family of open sets is open. Hence \( N(x) \) is the smallest neighborhood of \(x\). In the above paragraph, we showed that \( U_{R}(x) \subset N(x) \). Conversely let \( y \in N(x) \). Assume that \( x \nleq y \) then \( x \notin \overline{\left\{ y \right\}} \) so there is a neighborhood of \( x \) not containing \( y \), which contradicts \( y \in N(x) \) and the definition of \(N(x)\). Hence \( x \le y \), which implies \( y \in U_{R}(x) \). Therefore \( N(x) \subset U_{R}(x) \). Thus \( U_{R}(x) = N(x) \), so \( U_{R}(x) \) is open in \( \mathscr{T} \).

	\( \left\{ U_{R}(x) \right\} \subset \mathscr{T} \) and for every \( G \in \mathscr{T} \), every \( x \in G \), one has \( x \in U_{R}(x) \subset G \). This means \( \left\{ U_{R}(x) \right\} \) is a basis for \( \mathscr{T} \). Hence \( \mathscr{T} = \mathscr{T}_{R} \).

In \(X\times Y\), show that \( \overline{A \times B} = \overline{A} \times \overline{B} \); \( \operatorname{Int}(A \times B) = \operatorname{Int}(A) \times \operatorname{Int}(B) \); \( \operatorname{Fr}(A \times B) = (\operatorname{Fr}(A) \times \overline{B}) \cup (\overline{A} \times \operatorname{Fr}(B)) \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Suppose that \( (x, y) \in \overline{A \times B} \). Let \( U \) be a neighborhood of \(x\) and \(V\) be a neighborhood of \(y\) then \( U \times V \) is a neighborhood of \( (x, y) \), so \( U \times V \) intersects \( A \times B \). Since \( (U \times V) \cap (A \times B) = (U \cap A) \times (V \cap B) \) so \( U \cap A \ne \varnothing \) and \( V \cap B \ne \varnothing \). Therefore \( x \in \overline{A} \) and \( y \in \overline{B} \), which implies \( (x, y) \in \overline{A} \times \overline{B} \), so \( \overline{A \times B} \subset \overline{A} \times \overline{B} \).

	Suppose that \( (x, y) \in \overline{A} \times \overline{B} \). Let \( S \) be a neighborhood of \( (x, y) \) then there exists a basic open set \( U \times V \) such that \( (x, y) \in U \times V \subset S \). Because \( U \cap A \ne \varnothing \) and \( V \cap B \ne \varnothing \), it follows that \( U \times V \) intersects \( A \times B \), which means \( S \) intersects \( A \times B \). Hence \( (x, y) \in \overline{A \times B} \) and \( \overline{A} \times \overline{B} \subset \overline{A \times B} \).

	Thus \( \overline{A \times B} = \overline{A} \times \overline{B} \).

	Suppose that \( (x, y) \in \operatorname{Int}(A\times B) \) then there exists a neighborhood \(S\) of \( (x, y) \) contained in \( \operatorname{Int}(A\times B) \). There is a basic open set \( U\times V \) such that \( (x, y) \in U \times V \subset S \). Because \( U \times V \subset S \subset A \times B \) and \( U, V \) are nonempty, it follows that \( U \subset A \) and \( V \subset B \). So \( U \) is a neighborhood of \( x \) contained in \( A \) and \( V \) is a neighborhood of \(y\) contained in \(B\), therefore \( (x, y) \in \operatorname{Int}(A) \times \operatorname{Int}(B) \).

	Suppose that \( (x, y) \in \operatorname{Int}(A) \times \operatorname{Int}(B) \) then there is a neighborhood \(U\) of \(x\) and a neighborhood \(V\) of \(y\) such that \( U \subset A \) and \( V \subset B \). Therefore \( (x, y) \in U\times V \subset A\times B \). Moreover, \( U\times V \) is a neighborhood of \( (x, y) \) so \( (x, y) \in U \times V \subset \operatorname{Int}(A \times B) \).

	Thus \( \operatorname{Int}(A\times B) = \operatorname{Int}(A) \times \operatorname{Int}(B) \).

\begin{problem}{III.4.19}
If every countable subset of a space is closed, is the topology necessarily discrete?
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	No. It is not necessary. Here we provide a counterexample.

	Let \(X\) be an uncountable set. We define
	\[
		\mathscr{T} = \left\{ \varnothing, X, \text{ all subsets of \(X\) whose complement is countable } \right\}
	\]

	If \( {(A_{\alpha})}_{\alpha\in \mathscr{A}} \) is a family of elements of \( \mathscr{T} \) then
	\[
		X - \bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} A_{\alpha} = \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}}(X - A_{\alpha}) \text{ is countable}
	\]

	so \( \bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} A_{\alpha} \in \mathscr{T} \). Moreover, if \( A, B \in \mathscr{T} \) then
	\[
		X - (A \cap B) = (X - A) \cup (X - B) \text{ is countable}
	\]

	so \( A \cap B \in \mathscr{T} \). Hence \( \mathscr{T} \) is a topology on \(X\).

	Every singleton subset of \(X\) is closed. Let \(a, b\) be two distinct points of \(X\). There exist neighborhoods \(A \ni a\) and \(B \ni b\) such that \(b \notin A\) and \(a \notin B\). The complement \( X - (A \cap B) = (X - A) \cup (X - B) \) is countable so \( A \cap B \) is nonempty. Hence \( X \) is not discrete as any two distinct points doesn't have disjoint neighborhoods.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.4.20}
A point \(a \in A\) is called isolated whenever \(a \in A - A^{\prime}\). A set is called perfect if it is closed and has no isolated points. Prove: (1) If \(A\) has no isolated points, then \(\overline{A}\) is perfect. (2) If a space \(X\) has no isolated points, then every open set in \(X\) also have no isolated points.
\end{problem}

\begin{quotation}
	If a space \(X\) has no isolated points, then it is not necessary that every dense subset of \(X\) has no isolated points. A sufficient condition for this is \(X\) being a \(T_{1}\) space (for every pair of distinct points, each has a neighborhood not containing the other point).
\end{quotation}

\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\arabic*)}]
		\item \( \overline{A} \) is closed by definition. Let \( x \in \overline{A} \).

		      If \( x \in A \) then \(x\) is not an isolated point of \(A\) hence not an isolated point of \(\overline{A}\).

		      If \( x \notin A \) then \( x \in A^{\prime} \) so every neighborhood of \(x\) intersects \( A = A - \left\{x\right\} \), hence \(x\) is not an isolated point of \(\overline{A}\).

		      Therefore \(\overline{A}\) doesn't have any isolated points, thus \(\overline{A}\) is perfect if \(A\) has no isolated points.
		\item Let \(U\) be an open set of \(X\) and \(x\) an element of \(U\). For every neighborhood \(V\) of \(x\), one has \( (U \cap V) - \left\{x\right\} \ne \varnothing \) because \(X\) has no isolated points. Hence every neigborhood of \(x\) intersects \( U - \left\{x\right\} \), which means every element of \(U\) is a cluster point, hence \(U\) has no isolated point.

Call a set residual if its complement is dense, and call it nowhere dense if its closure has empty interior. Prove: (1) A nowhere dense set is a redisual set.

(4) The boundary of a closed (or open) set is nowhere dense. (5) For any set \(A\), both \(A \cap \overline{\mathscr{C}(A)}\) and \( \overline{A} \cap \mathscr{C}(A) \) are residual. (6) The boundary of any set is the union of two residual sets.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\arabic*)},itemsep=0pt,leftmargin=*]
		\item Let \(A\) be a nowhere dense subset of a topological space. From the definition of nowhere dense set, \( \operatorname{Int}(\overline{A}) = \varnothing \).

		      The complement of \( \overline{\mathscr{C}(A)} \) is the interior of \(A\). Moreover, \( \operatorname{Int}(A) \subset \operatorname{Int}(\overline{A}) = \varnothing \) so \( \operatorname{Int}(A) = \varnothing \). Hence \( \overline{\mathscr{C}(A)} = X \), which means \(A\) is also a residual set.
		\item If \(A\) is nowhere dense then \( \operatorname{Int}(\overline{A}) = \varnothing \). Since \( \overline{\mathscr{C}(\overline{A})} = \mathscr{C}(\operatorname{Int}(\overline{A})) \) then \( \overline{\mathscr{C}(\overline{A})} \) is the entire ambient space, which means \( A \subset \overline{\mathscr{C}(\overline{A})} \).

		      Conversely, suppose that \( A \subset \overline{\mathscr{C}(\overline{A})} \). Because \( \overline{\mathscr{C}(\overline{A})} = \mathscr{C}(\operatorname{Int}(\overline{A})) \) then \( A \subset \mathscr{C}(\operatorname{Int}(\overline{A})) \), so \( \operatorname{Int}(\overline{A}) \subset \mathscr{C}A \), which means \( \operatorname{Int}(\overline{A}) \subset \operatorname{Int}(\mathscr{C}A) = \mathscr{C}(\overline{A}) \). Since \( \operatorname{Int}(\overline{A}) \subset \overline{A} \) and \( \mathscr{C}(\overline{A}) \) are disjoint, we deduce that \( \operatorname{Int}(\overline{A}) = \varnothing \). Hence \(A\) is nowhere dense.
		\item Let \(A\) be a residual set and \(B\) a nowhere dense set.

		      \( \mathscr{C}A \) is dense by definition.

		      \( \varnothing = \operatorname{Int}(\overline{B}) = \mathscr{C}(\overline{\mathscr{C}(\overline{B})}) \) so \( \mathscr{C}(\overline{B}) \) is dense. Moreover, \( \mathscr{C}(B) \supset \mathscr{C}(\overline{B}) \) so \( \mathscr{C} \) is also dense.

		      \( \mathscr{C}(A \cup B) = \mathscr{C}(A) \cap \mathscr{C}(B) \supset \mathscr{C}(A) \cap \mathscr{C}(\overline{B}) \). The set \( \mathscr{C}(\overline{B}) \) is open so according to Problem~\ref{problem:III.4.13}, \( \overline{\mathscr{C}(A) \cap \mathscr{C}(\overline{B})} = \overline{\mathscr{C}\overline{B}} \). Hence \(\mathscr{C}(A) \cap \mathscr{C}(\overline{B})\) is dense, which implies that \(\mathscr{C}(A) \cap \mathscr{C}(B)\) is dense. Therefore \(A \cup B\) is a residual set.
		\item Let \(A\) be a subset of a topological space. Because \( \operatorname{Fr}(A) = \overline{A} \cap \overline{\mathscr{C}A} \), the boundary of \(A\) is a closed set.

		      If \(A\) is closed then \( \operatorname{Fr}(A) \subset \overline{A} \). Every neighborhood of every point in \( \operatorname{Fr}(A) \) intersects \(A\) and \(\mathscr{C}A\). Moreover, \( \mathscr{C}A \) and \( A = \overline{A} \) are disjoint so \( \mathscr{C}A \) and \( \operatorname{Fr}(A) \subset \overline{A} \) are disjoint. Hence \( \operatorname{Fr}(A) \) has no interior point if \(A\) is closed.

		      If \(A\) is open then \(\mathscr{C}A\) is closed and \(\operatorname{Fr}(A) = \operatorname{Fr}(\mathscr{C}A)\) so \( \operatorname{Fr}(A) \) has no interior point.

		      Thus \( \operatorname{Fr}(A) \) has no interior point whenever \(A\) is closed (or open). Moreover, \( \operatorname{Fr}(A) \) is closed, so \( \operatorname{Int}(\overline{\operatorname{Fr}(A)}) = \operatorname{Int}(\operatorname{Fr}(A)) = \varnothing \), which means \( \operatorname{Fr}(A) \) is nowhere dense.
		\item We will show that the complement of these sets are dense.

	\item If \(U, V\) are regular open sets, so also is \(U \cap V\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*,label={(\alph*)},itemsep=0pt]
		\item Let \( B = \operatorname{Int}(A) \) then \(B\) is open.

		      \( \operatorname{Int}(\overline{B}) \) is the largest open set contained in \( \overline{B} \) so \( B \subset \operatorname{Int}(\overline{B}) \).

		      %   \( B = \operatorname{Int}(A) \subset A \) so \( \overline{B} \subset A \) (as \(A\) is closed), which implies \( \mathscr{C}(\overline{B}) \supset \mathscr{C}(A) \), therefore \( \overline{\mathscr{C}(\overline{B})} \supset \overline{\mathscr{C}(A)} \). Since \( \overline{\mathscr{C}(\overline{B})} = \mathscr{C}(\operatorname{Int}(\overline{B})) \) and \( \overline{\mathscr{C}A} = \mathscr{C}(\operatorname{Int}(A)) = \mathscr{C}(B) \), we deduce that \( \mathscr{C}(\operatorname{Int}(\overline{B})) \supset \mathscr{C}(B) \), which precisely means \( \operatorname{Int}(\overline{B}) \subset B \) (because larger sets have smaller complement and vice versa).

		      \( B = \operatorname{Int}(A) \subset A \) so \( \overline{B} \subset A \) (as \(A\) is closed), which implies \( \operatorname{Int}(\overline{B}) \subset \operatorname{Int}(A) = B \).

		      Thus \( B = \operatorname{Int}(\overline{B}) \), so \( B \) is a regular open set.
		\item Let \( V = \overline{U} \) then \( V \) is closed.

		      \( \overline{\operatorname{Int}(V)} \) is the smallest closed set containing \( \operatorname{Int}(V) \) and \( \operatorname{Int}(V) \subset V \) so \( \overline{\operatorname{Int}(V)} \subset V \).

		      \( V = \overline{U} \supset U \) so \( \operatorname{Int}(V) \supset U \) (as \(U\) is open), which implies \( \overline{\operatorname{Int}(V)} \supset \overline{U} = V \).

		      Hence \( V = \overline{\operatorname{Int}(V)} \), which means \( V \) is a regular closed set.
		\item For any set \(S\), one has \( \mathscr{C}(\operatorname{Int}(\overline{S})) = \overline{\mathscr{C}(\overline{S})} = \overline{\operatorname{Int}(\mathscr{C}(S))} \).
		      \[
			      S = \operatorname{Int}(\overline{S}) \iff \mathscr{C}(S) = \mathscr{C}(\operatorname{Int}(\overline{S})) \iff \mathscr{C}(S) = \overline{\operatorname{Int}(\mathscr{C}(S))}
		      \]

		      so \( S \) is a regular open set if and only if its complement is a regular closed set.

		      Therefore the complement of a regular open set is a regular closed set and vice versa.
		\item \( U \subset V \) implies \( \overline{U} \subset \overline{V} \).

		      Conversely, \( \overline{U} \subset \overline{V} \) implies \( U = \operatorname{Int}(\overline{U}) \subset \operatorname{Int}(\overline{V}) = V \).

		\item \( A \subset B \) implies \( \operatorname{Int}(A) \subset \operatorname{Int}(B) \).

		      Conversely, \( \operatorname{Int}(A) \subset \operatorname{Int}(B) \) implies \( A = \overline{\operatorname{Int}(A)} \subset \overline{\operatorname{Int}(B)} = B \).
		\item If \( A, B \) are regular closed sets, then \( A \cup B \) is closed.

		      \( A \cup B = \overline{\operatorname{Int}(A)} \cup \overline{\operatorname{Int}(B)} = \overline{\operatorname{Int}(A) \cup \operatorname{Int}(B)} \subset \overline{\operatorname{Int}(A \cup B)} \) since \( \operatorname{Int}(A) \cup \operatorname{Int}(B) \subset \operatorname{Int}(A \cup B) \).

\section{Topologizing with preassigned elementary operations}

\begin{proposition}{5.2}
	Let \(X\) be a set, and \( \gamma: \mathscr{P}(X) \to \mathscr{P}(X) \) a map such that:
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\arabic*)}]
		\item \( \gamma(\varnothing) = \varnothing \).
		\item \( \gamma \circ \gamma (A) \subset A \cup \gamma(A) \).
		\item \( \gamma(A \cup B) = \gamma(A) \cup \gamma(B) \).
		\item For each \( x \in X, x \notin \gamma(\left\{x\right\}) \).
	\end{enumerate}

	Then \( \mathscr{T} = \left\{ \mathscr{C}(A \cup \gamma(A)) \mid A \in \mathscr{P}(X) \right\} \) is a topology, and \( A^{\prime} = \gamma(A) \).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	Firstly, we show that
	\[
		A \subset B \implies \gamma(A) \subset \gamma(B).
	\]

	If \( A \subset B \) then \( B = A \cup B \), from which we deduce that \( \gamma(A) \subset \gamma(A) \cup \gamma(B) = \gamma(A \cup B) = \gamma(B) \).

	Consequently,
	\[ A \subset B \implies A \cup \gamma(A) \subset B \cup \gamma(B). \]

	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\roman*)}]
		\item \( X = \mathscr{C}(\varnothing \cup \gamma(\varnothing)) \) so \( X \in \mathscr{T} \).

		      \( \varnothing = \mathscr{C}(X) = \mathscr{C}(X \cup \gamma(X)) \) so \( \varnothing \in \mathscr{T} \).
		\item According to De Morgan's law,
		      \[  \mathscr{C}(A \cup \gamma(A)) \cap \mathscr{C}(B \cup \gamma(B)) = \mathscr{C}((A \cup \gamma(A)) \cup (B \cup \gamma(B))) = \mathscr{C}((A \cup B) \cup \gamma(A \cup B)) \]

		      Hence \(\mathscr{C}(A \cup \gamma(A)) \cap \mathscr{C}(B \cup \gamma(B)) \in \mathscr{T}\).
		\item Let \( S = \bigcup_{\alpha} \mathscr{C}(A_{\alpha} \cup \gamma(A_{\alpha})) \) then \( \mathscr{C}S = \mathscr{C}\bigcup_{\alpha} \mathscr{C}(A_{\alpha} \cup \gamma(A_{\alpha})) = \bigcap_{\alpha}(A_{\alpha} \cup \gamma(A_{\alpha})) \).

		      Hence \( \gamma(\mathscr{C}S) \subset \gamma(A_{\alpha} \cup \gamma(A_{\alpha})) \) for every \( \alpha \) as \( \mathscr{C}S \subset A_{\alpha} \cup \gamma(A_{\alpha}) \), which implies that
		      \[
			      \gamma(\mathscr{C}S) \subset \gamma(A_{\alpha} \cup \gamma(A_{\alpha})) = \gamma(A_{\alpha}) \cup \gamma\circ\gamma(A_{\alpha}) \subset \gamma(A_{\alpha}) \cup (A_{\alpha} \cup \gamma(A_{\alpha})) = A_{\alpha} \cup \gamma(A_{\alpha})
		      \]

		      for every \(\alpha\), so
		      \[
			      \gamma(\mathscr{C}S) \subset \bigcap_{\alpha} (A_{\alpha} \cup \gamma(A_{\alpha})) = \mathscr{C}S.
		      \]

		      Therefore \( \mathscr{C}S = \mathscr{C}(S) \cup \gamma(\mathscr{C}S) \), which means \( S = \mathscr{C}(\mathscr{C}(S) \cup \gamma(\mathscr{C}S)) \), so \( S \in \mathscr{T} \).
	\end{enumerate}

	Hence \( \mathscr{T} \) is a topology on \(X\).

	According to Proposition 5.1, \( A \cup \gamma(A) = \overline{A} \).

	If \( x \in A^{\prime} \) then \( x \in \overline{A - \left\{x\right\}} = (A - \left\{x\right\}) \cup \gamma(A - \left\{x\right\}) \), which means \( x \in \gamma(A - \left\{x\right\}) \subset \gamma(A) \). Hence \( A^{\prime} \subset \gamma(A) \).

	Let \( x \in \gamma(A) \). Assume that there exists a neighborhood \(U\) of \(x\) such that \( U \cap (A - \left\{x\right\}) = \varnothing \). Therefore \( A - \left\{x\right\} \subset \mathscr{C}U \).
	\[
		\gamma(A) = \gamma((A - \left\{x\right\}) \cup \left\{x\right\}) = \gamma(A - \left\{x\right\}) \cup \gamma(\left\{x\right\})
	\]

	Since \( x \notin \gamma(\left\{x\right\}) \), it follows that \( x \in \gamma(A - \left\{ x \right\}) \subset \gamma(\mathscr{C}U) \). Moreover, \( \mathscr{C}U \) is closed so \( \gamma(\mathscr{C}U) \subset \overline{\mathscr{C}U} = \mathscr{C}U \), which means \( x \in \mathscr{C}U \), this is a contradiction as \( x \in U \).

	Hence every neighborhood of \(x\) intersects \( A - \left\{x\right\} \) non-trivially, so \( \gamma(A) \subset A^{\prime} \).

	Thus \( A^{\prime} = \gamma(A) \).
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}{5.3}
	Let \(X\) be a set, and \( \eta: \mathscr{P}(X) \to \mathscr{P}(X) \) a map such that:
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\arabic*)}]
		\item \( \eta(X) = X \).
		\item \( \eta(A) \subset A \).
		\item \( \eta \circ \eta(A) = \eta(A) \).
		\item \( \eta(A \cap B) = \eta(A) \cap \eta(B) \).
	\end{enumerate}

	Then \( \mathscr{T} = \left\{ \eta(A) \mid A \in \mathscr{P}(X) \right\} \) is a topology, and \( \operatorname{Int}(A) = \eta(A) \).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	If \( A \subset B \) then
	\[
		\eta(A) = \eta(A \cap B) = \eta(A) \cap \eta(B) \subset \eta(B).
	\]

	Therefore \( A \subset B \implies \eta(A) \subset \eta(B) \).
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\roman*)}]
		\item \( X = \eta(X) \) so \( X \in \mathscr{T} \).

		      \( \eta(\varnothing) \subset \varnothing \) so \( \varnothing = \eta(\varnothing) \in \mathscr{T} \).
		\item \( \eta(A) \cap \eta(B) = \eta(A \cap B) \in \mathscr{T} \).
		\item Let \( S = \bigcup_{\alpha} \eta(A_{\alpha}) \) then
		      \[
			      \eta(S) = \eta\left( \bigcup_{\alpha} \eta(A_{\alpha}) \right) \supset \eta(\eta(A_{\alpha}))
		      \]

		      for every \(\alpha\), from which we obtain that
		      \[
			      \eta(S) \supset \bigcup_{\alpha}\eta(\eta(A_{\alpha})) = \bigcup_{\alpha} \eta(A_{\alpha}) = S.
		      \]

		      Since \( \eta(S) \subset S \), we conclude that \( S = \eta(S) \), which means \( S \in \mathscr{T} \).
	\end{enumerate}

	Hence \( \mathscr{T} \) is a topology on \(X\).

	\( \operatorname{Int}(A) \) is the largest open set contained in \( A \) so \( \eta(A) \subset \operatorname{Int}(A) \).

	\( \operatorname{Int}(A) \) is open in \(X\) so \( \operatorname{Int}(A) = \eta(B) \) for some \( B \subset X \). Since \( A \supset \operatorname{Int}(A) \)
	\[
		\eta(A) \supset \eta(\operatorname{Int}(A)) = \eta\circ\eta(B) = \eta(B) = \operatorname{Int}(A).
	\]

	Hence \( \operatorname{Int}(A) = \eta(A) \).
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}{5.4}
	Let \(X\) be a set, and \( \beta: \mathscr{P}(X) \to \mathscr{P}(X) \) a map such that:
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\arabic*)}]
		\item \( \beta(\varnothing) = \varnothing \).
		\item \( \beta(A) = \beta(\mathscr{C}A) \).
		\item \( \beta \circ \beta(A) \subset \beta(A) \).
		\item \( A \cap B \cap \beta(A \cap B) = A \cap B \cap \left[\beta(A) \cup \beta(B)\right] \).
	\end{enumerate}

	Then \( \mathscr{T} = \left\{ \mathscr{C}(A \cup \beta(A)) \mid A \in \mathscr{P}(X) \right\} \) is a topology, and \( \operatorname{Fr}(A) = \beta(A) \).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	We show that \( U \in \mathscr{T} \) if and only if \( U \cap \beta(U) = \varnothing \).

	If \( U \in \mathscr{T} \) then \( U = \mathscr{C}(A \cup \beta(A)) \) for some \( A \subset X \).
	\begingroup
	\allowdisplaybreaks%
	\begin{align*}
		U \cap \beta(U) & = \mathscr{C}(A) \cap \mathscr{C}(\beta(A)) \cap \beta(\mathscr{C}(A) \cap \mathscr{C}(\beta(A)))                       \\
		                & = \mathscr{C}(A) \cap \mathscr{C}(\beta(A)) \cap \left[ \beta(\mathscr{C}(A)) \cup \beta(\mathscr{C}(\beta(A))) \right] \\
		                & = \mathscr{C}(A) \cap \mathscr{C}(\beta(A)) \cap \left[ \beta(A) \cup \beta(\beta(A)) \right]                           \\
		                & = \mathscr{C}(A) \cap \mathscr{C}(\beta(A)) \cap \beta(A)                                                               \\
		                & = \mathscr{C}(A) \cap \varnothing                                                                                       \\
		                & = \varnothing.
	\end{align*}
	\endgroup

	Conversely, \( U \cap \beta(U) = \varnothing \) implies \( \beta(U) \subset \mathscr{C}U \), so
	\[
		\mathscr{C}(\mathscr{C}(U) \cup \beta(\mathscr{C}U)) = \mathscr{C}(\mathscr{C}(U) \cup \beta(U)) = \mathscr{C}(\mathscr{C}(U)) = U
	\]

	which means \( U \in \mathscr{T} \).

	Therefore \( \mathscr{T} = \left\{ U \subset X \mid U \cap \beta(U) = \varnothing \right\} \).

	Also we use the following lemma: \textbf{If \( A \cap \beta(A) = \varnothing \) then \( A \cap \beta(B) = \varnothing \) whenever \( A \subset B \). }

	This is a contradiction since \( x \in \beta(A) \) and \( U \cap \beta(A) = \varnothing \).

	Hence for every \( x \in \beta(A) \), for every neighborhood \( U \) of \(x\), one has \( U \cap A \ne \varnothing \) and \( U \cap \mathscr{C}A \ne \varnothing \), this means \( x \in \operatorname{Fr}(A) \). Therefore \( \beta(A) \subset \operatorname{Fr}(A) \).

\begin{proof}
	\( \varnothing, X \in \mathscr{T} \).

	\( \mathscr{C}A \cap \mathscr{C}B = \mathscr{C}(A \cup B) \) so \( \mathscr{C}A \cap \mathscr{C}B \in \mathscr{T} \) whenever \( A, B \in \mathscr{A} \).

	\( \bigcup_{\alpha} \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha} = \mathscr{C}\bigcap_{\alpha}A_{\alpha} \in \mathscr{T} \) whenever \( A_{\alpha} \in \mathscr{A} \).

\begin{problem}{III.5.1}
Let \(A \mapsto u(A)\) and \(A \mapsto v(A)\) be two closure operations. Assume that \( v\circ u(A) \) is \(u\)-closed. Prove that \( A \mapsto v\circ u(A) \) is a closure operation and that \(v\circ u(A)\) is in fact the intersection of all sets containing \(A\) that are closed in both \(u\) and \(v\). Finally, show that \(u\circ v(A) \subset v\circ u(A)\).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\arabic*)}]
		\item \( v\circ u(\varnothing) = v(u(\varnothing)) = v(\varnothing) = \varnothing \)
		\item \( A \subset u(A) \subset v(u(A)) = v\circ u(A) \).
		\item \( v\circ u \circ v\circ u(A) = v\circ v\circ u(A) \) because \( v\circ u(A) \) is \(u\)-closed. Because \( v\circ u(A) \) is \(v\)-closed, it follows that \( v\circ v\circ u(A) = v\circ u(A) \). Hence \( v\circ u \circ v\circ u(A) = v\circ u(A) \).
		\item \( v\circ u(A \cup B) = v(u(A \cup B)) = v(u(A) \cup u(B)) = v(u(A)) \cup v(u(B)) = v\circ u(A) \cup v\circ u(B) \).
	\end{enumerate}

	Therefore \( v\circ u \) is a closure operation.

	Let \(B\) be a superset of \(A\) that is closed in both \(u\) and \(v\), then \( v\circ u(A) \subset v\circ u(B) = B \), which means \( v\circ u(A) \) is the smallest set that is closed in both \(u\) and \(v\) and contains \(A\). Hence \( v\circ u(A) \) is the intersection of all sets containing \(A\) that are closed in both \(u\) and \(v\).

	One has \( A \subset u(A) \) so \( v(A) \subset v\circ u(A) \). Therefore \( u \circ v(A) \subset u\circ v\circ u(A) \). Since \( v\circ u(A) \) is \(u\)-closed, we deduce that \( u\circ v\circ u(A) = v\circ u(A) \). Hence \( u\circ v(A) \subset v\circ u(A) \).

		      Hence \( A \subset \varphi^{-1} \circ \varphi(A) \).
		\item From (2), it follows that \( u(A) \subset u \circ u(A) \).

		      Let \( x \in u \circ u(A) = \varphi^{-1} \circ \varphi \circ \varphi^{-1} \circ \varphi(A) \) then \( \varphi(x) \subset \varphi \circ \varphi^{-1} \circ \varphi(A) \) and \( \varphi(x) \ne \varnothing \).

		      \( \varphi(x) \subset \varphi \circ \varphi^{-1} \circ \varphi(A) \) means \( x \in \varphi^{-1} \circ \varphi(A) \) by definition.

		      Therefore \( u \circ u(A) \subset u(A) \). Hence \( u \circ u(A) = u(A) \).
	\end{enumerate}

	Suppose that \( A_{1} \subset A_{2} \subset X \) then \( \varphi(A_{1}) \subset \varphi(A_{2}) \) by definition.

	Therefore \( \varphi^{-1} \circ \varphi(A_{1}) \subset \varphi^{-1} \circ \varphi(A_{2}) \), which means \( u(A_{1}) \subset u(A_{2}) \).

\begin{problem}{III.6.1}\label{problem:III.6.1}
A set is bivalent if it is both an \(F_{\sigma}\) and a \(G_{\delta}\). Show that the complements, finite unions, and finite intersections of bivalent sets are bivalent.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Let \(B\) be a bivalent set then \(B\) is both an \(F_{\sigma}\) and a \(G_{\delta}\) set. Since the complement of an \(F_{\sigma}\) is a \(G_{\delta}\) and the complement of a \(G_{\delta}\) is an \(F_{\sigma}\), it follows that the complement of \(B\) is bivalent.

	Let \( B_{1}, \ldots, B_{n} \) be bivalent sets then \( \bigcup^{n}_{i=1}B_{i} \) is a bivalent, since the union of at most countable \(F_{\sigma}\)-sets is an \(F_{\sigma}\)-set and the union of finitely many \(G_{\delta}\)-sets is a \(G_{\delta}\)-set.
\end{proof}

For the remaining problems (in this section), we assume that all closed sets are \(G_{\delta}\)-sets.

\begin{problem}{III.6.2}\label{problem:III.6.2}
Prove: Every \(F_{\sigma}\) is the disjoint union of bivalent sets.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Let \(F\) be an \(F_{\sigma}\)-set then \( F = \bigcup^{\infty}_{1} F_{i} \) in which each \(F_{i}\) is closed.

	Define \(A_{1} = F_{1}\) and \(A_{n+1} = F_{n+1} - \bigcup^{n}_{1} F_{i}\) then \( A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots \) are pairwise disjoint and
	\[
		\bigcup^{\infty}_{1} A_{i} = \bigcup^{\infty}_{1} F_{i}.
	\]

	Each \(F_{i}\) is bivalent (due to \(F_{i}\) being closed and the assumption after Problem~\ref{problem:III.6.1}) so each \(A_{i}\) is bivalent.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.6.3}\label{problem:III.6.3}
Prove: For every sequence \( \left\{ F_{i} \right\} \) of \(F_{\sigma}\)-sets, there exists a pairwise disjoint sequence \( \left\{ H_{i} \right\} \) of \(F_{\sigma}\)-sets with \(H_{i} \subset F_{i}\) for every \(i\) and \( \bigcup H_{i} = \bigcup F_{i} \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	According to Problem~\ref{problem:III.6.2}, \( F_{i} \) is a disjoint union of bivalent sets, \( F_{i} = \bigcup^{\infty}_{j=1} F_{i,j} \).

	Define \( H_{i} = \bigcup^{\infty}_{j=1} \left(F_{i,j} - \bigcup_{(k,\ell) < (i,j)} F_{k,\ell}\right) \) in which \( (k,\ell) < (i,j) \) if \( k < i \) or \( k = i \) and \( \ell < j \) (the dictionary order).

	Then \( H_{i} \subset \bigcup^{\infty}_{j=1} F_{i,j} = F_{i} \), \( \left\{ H_{i} \right\} \) are pairwise disjoint, and \( \bigcup H_{i} = \bigcup F_{i} \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.6.4}\label{problem:III.6.4}
Prove: If \( \left\{ G_{i} \right\} \) is any sequence of \(G_{\delta}\)-sets with \( \bigcap^{\infty}_{1} G_{i} = \varnothing \), there exists a sequence of bivalent sets \( \left\{ B_{i} \right\} \) with \(G_{i} \subset B_{i}\) and \( \bigcap^{\infty}_{1} B_{i} = \varnothing \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Let \( F_{i} = \mathscr{C}G_{i} \) then \( F_{i} \) is an \( F_{\sigma} \)-set.

	According to Problem~\ref{problem:III.6.3}, there exists a pairwise disjoint sequence \( \left\{ H_{i} \right\} \) of \(F_{\sigma}\)-sets with \(H_{i} \subset F_{i}\) for every \(i\) and \( \bigcup H_{i} = \bigcup F_{i} \). Let \( B_{i} = \mathscr{C}H_{i} \) then \( G_{i} \subset B_{i} \) and \( \bigcap^{\infty}_{1} B_{i} = \bigcap^{\infty}_{i=1} G_{i} = \varnothing \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.6.5}
Prove: (a) If \(G, H\) are disjoint \(G_{\delta}\)-sets, there exists a bivalent set \(B\) with \(H \subset B\) and \( B \cap G = \varnothing \).

(b) If \(G\) is a \(G_{\delta}\) and \(F\) is an \(F_{\sigma}\) such that \(G \subset F\), there exists a bivalent \(B\) with \( G \subset B \subset F \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
		\item Because
		      \[
			      H \cap G \cap \cdots \cap G \cap \cdots = \varnothing
		      \]

		      there exists a sequence of bivalent sets \( \left\{ B_{i} \right\} \) with \(G \subset B_{i}\) for \(i>1\) and \(H \subset B_{1}\) and \( \bigcap^{\infty}_{1} B_{i} = \varnothing \), according to Problem~\ref{problem:III.6.4}.

		      \(B_{1}\) is a bivalent set, \( H \subset B_{1} \) and \( B_{1} \cap G = B_{1} \cap G \cap \cdots \cap G \cap \cdots \subset \bigcap^{\infty}_{i=1} B_{i} = \varnothing \).

		      Let \( B = B_{1} \) then \(B\) is a bivalent, \( H \subset B \) and \( B \cap G = \varnothing \).
		\item \( G \subset F \) so \( G \) and \( \mathscr{C}F \) are disjoint. Moreover, they are \( G_{\delta} \)-sets.

		      According to part (a), there is a bivalent set \(B\) such that \( G \subset B \) and \( B \cap \mathscr{C}F = \varnothing \).

		      \( B \cap \mathscr{C}F = \varnothing \) is equivalent to \( B \subset F \). Hence \( G \subset B \subset F \).
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\section{Relativization}

\begin{problem}{III.7.1}
In \( {\tilde{E}}^{1} \), show that for any set \(A\), \(\sup A \in \overline{A}\).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	If \( A \) is empty then \( \sup A = -\infty \in \tilde{E}^{1} \).

	Otherwise, \( A \) is nonempty then either it has an upper bound or not. If \(A\) is nonempty and has an upper bound then \(A\) has a least upper bound (the least upper bound property of \(\mathbb{R}\)), so \( \sup A \) is well-defined and \( \sup A \in E^{1} \subset \tilde{E}^{1} \). If \( A \) is nonempty and doesn't have an upper bound then \( \sup A = +\infty \in \tilde{E}^{1} \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.7.2}
Describe the relative topology of \( \left\{ z \mid \left\vert{z}\right\vert = 1 \right\} \) as a subspace of \(E^{2}\).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	A basis for the relative topology of the given set is \( \left\{ \exp(\iota t) \mid t \in \openinterval{a,b} \right\} \)
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.7.3}
Show that the rationals, as a subspace of \(E^{1}\), do not have the discrete topology.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Let \(U\) be a nonempty open subset of the rationals (the set of rationals is considered a subspace of \(E^{1}\)). From the definition of subspace topologies, there exists an open subset \(V \subset E^{1}\) such that \(U = V \cap \mathbb{Q}\). Since \(V\) is an open subset of \(E^{1}\), it contains some open interval \(\openinterval{a, b}\). Every open interval contains infinitely many rationals, hence \(U\) contains infinitely many rationals.

	Therefore every nonempty open subset of the rationals is not a singleton, which means the rationals, as a subspace of \(E^{1}\), don't have the discrete topology.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.7.4}
Let \(K \subset E^{1}\) be the set of irrationals in \( \openinterval{0,1} \). Expressing each \(x, y\in K\) as decimals, define \( d(x, y) = 1/n \) if \(x\) and \(y\) have their first \( (n - 1) \) digits identical, and their \(n\) th digits different. Let \( B(x; 1/n) = \left\{ y \in K \mid d(x, y) < 1/n \right\} \). Show that the \( \left\{ B(x; 1/n) \mid x \in K, n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \right\} \) is a basis for a topology \( \mathscr{T} \) on \(K\), and prove that \( \mathscr{T} \) coinicides with the induced topology of \(K\) as a subspace of \(E^{1}\).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	By definition, for every \( x, y \in K \), \( d(x, y) = 0 \) if and only if \( x = y \). Moreover, \( d(x, y) = d(y, x) \) for every \( x, y \in K \).

	Let \( x, y, z \in K \), we aim to prove that \( d(x, y) + d(y, z) \ge d(x, z) \). If \( x = y \) or \( y = z \) or \( x = z \) then the inequality is true. Assume that \( x, y, z \) are pairwise distinct.

	Let \( d(x, y) = 1/n \) and \( d(y, z) = 1/m \). Without loss of generality, assume that \( m \ge n \), then \( d(x, z) \le 1/n \), which implies \( d(x, z) \le d(x, y) + d(y, z) \). Therefore \( (K, d) \) is a metric space, so \( \left\{ B(x; 1/n) \mid x \in K, n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \right\} \) is a basis for the metric topology on \( K \).

	Consider an open ball \( B(x; 1/n) \) and the first \( n - 1 \) digits in the decimal expansion of \( x \) is \( a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n-1} \). Let \( a = 0.a_{1}a_{2}\cdots a_{n-1} \) and \( b = a + \sum^{\infty}_{k=n}\dfrac{9}{10^{k}} \) then \( B(x; 1/n) = K \cap \openinterval{a, b} \), which means \( B(x; 1/n) \) is an open set in the induced topology of \( K \). Therefore the induced topology of \(K\) is finer than the metric topology on \( K \).

	Conversely, consider \( \openinterval{a, b} \cap K \) for some open interval \( \openinterval{a, b} \). Let \( x \in \openinterval{a, b} \cap K \) then there exists \( \varepsilon > 0 \) such that \( \openinterval{x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon} \subset \openinterval{a, b} \). If \( d(x, y) = \dfrac{1}{n} \) then \( \left\vert{x - y}\right\vert \le 10^{1-n} \). There exists a positive integer \(N\) such that \( 10^{1-N} < \varepsilon \) so \( d(x, y) < 1/n \) whenever \( \left\vert{x - y}\right\vert \le 10^{1-n} \), which means
	\[
		x \in \openinterval{x - 10^{1-N}, x + 10^{1-N}} \cap K \subset \openinterval{x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon} \cap K \subset \openinterval{a, b} \cap K
	\]

	so the induced topology of \( K \) is coarser than the metric topology on \( K \).

	Hence \( \mathscr{T} \) coincides with the induced topology of \(K\) as a subspace of \( E^{1} \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.7.5}
Let \(A \subset B\) be open in \(B\). Show: For any set \( S \), \( A \cap S \) is open in \( B \cap S \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Let \( \mathscr{B} \) be a basis for the topology on \(B\) then \( \left\{ U \cap S \mid U \in \mathscr{B} \right\} \) is a basis for the subspace \( B \cap S \).

	\( A \) is open in \( B \) so there exists a collection \( {\left\{ U_{i} \right\}}_{i\in I} \) of elements of \( \mathscr{B} \) such that \( A = \bigcup_{i\in I} U_{i} \). Therefore
	\[
		A \cap S = \left(\bigcup_{i\in I} U_{i}\right) \cap S = \bigcup_{i\in I} (U_{i} \cap S)
	\]

	which means \( A \cap S \) is open in \( B \cap S \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.7.6}
Let \( Y_{1}, Y_{2} \) be (not necessarily disjoint) subspaces of \(X\), and \( A \subset Y_{1} \cap Y_{2} \). Assume that \( A \) is open (closed) in \(Y_{1}\) and open (closed) in \(Y_{2}\). Prove: \( A \) is open (closed) in \( Y_{1} \cup Y_{2} \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	If \( A \) is open (closed) in \( Y_{1} \) and \( Y_{2} \) then there exist open (closed) sets \( U_{1}, U_{2} \subset X \) such that \( A = Y_{1} \cap U_{1} = Y_{2} \cap U_{2} \). Besides \( U_{1} \cap U_{2} \) is open (closed) in \(X\) and
	\begingroup
	\allowdisplaybreaks%
	\begin{align*}
		(Y_{1} \cup Y_{2}) \cap (U_{1} \cap U_{2}) & = (Y_{1} \cap U_{1} \cap U_{2}) \cup (Y_{2} \cap U_{1} \cap U_{2}) \\
		                                           & = (A \cap U_{2}) \cup (A \cap U_{1})                               \\
		                                           & = A \cap (U_{1} \cup U_{2})                                        \\
		                                           & = A.
	\end{align*}
	\endgroup

	Hence \( A \) is open (closed) in \( Y_{1} \cup Y_{2} \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.7.7}
Let \(A \subset X\) be closed and \( U \subset A \) open in \(A\). Let \(V\) be any set open in \(X\) with \( U \subset V \). Prove: \( U \cup (V - A) \) is open in \(X\).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\( U \subset A \) is open in \(A\) so there is an open set \( W \subset X \) such that \( U = W \cap A \).
	\begingroup
	\allowdisplaybreaks%
	\begin{align*}
		U \cup (V - A) & = U \cup (V \cap (X - A))                         \\
		               & = (U \cup V) \cap (U \cup (X - A))                \\
		               & = V \cap (U \cup (X - A))                         \\
		               & = V \cap ((W \cap A) \cup (X - A))                \\
		               & = V \cap ((W \cup (X - A)) \cap (A \cup (X - A))) \\
		               & = V \cap ((W \cup (X - A)) \cap X)                \\
		               & = V \cap (W \cup (X - A)).
	\end{align*}
	\endgroup

	Since \( V, W, X - A \) are open in \( X \), it follows that \( U \cup (V - A) \) is open in \( X \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.7.8}
\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
	\item Let \(D\) be dense in \(X\). Give an example to show \( D \cap A \) need not be dense in \(A\).
	\item Prove: If \(A\) is dense in \(B \subset X\), then \(A\) is dense in \( \overline{B} \).
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
		\item Let \( X = \mathbb{R}, D = \mathbb{Q}, A = \mathbb{R} - \mathbb{Q} \).

		      \( D \) is dense in \(X\) but \( D \cap A = \varnothing \) is not dense in \( A \).
		\item Let \( U \) be a nonempty open subset of \( \overline{B} \) then \( U \) intersects \( B \). \( U \cap B \) is a nonempty open subset of \( B \). Because \( A \) is dense in \( B \) then \( U \cap B \) intersects \( A \). Therefore \( (U \cap B) \cap A \ne \varnothing \). Moreover, \( (U \cap B) \cap A = U \cap (B \cap A) = U \cap A \) as \( A \subset B \). Hence \( U \) intersects \( A \), which means any nonempty open subset of \( \overline{B} \) intersects \( A \), which implies that \( A \) is dense in \( \overline{B} \).
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.7.9}
Let \(X\) be the set of Problem~\ref{problem:III.3.6}, with the topology \( \mathscr{T}_{R} \). Let \( A \subset X \), and using the induced ordering on \(A\), obtain \( \mathscr{T}_{R}(A) \). Show that \( \mathscr{T}_{R}(A) \) coincides with the induced topology on \(A\) as a subspace of \(X\).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Let \( \mathscr{T}_{A} \) be the induced topology on \(A\) as a subspace of \(X\).

	\textbf{Prove that \( \mathscr{T}_{A} \subset \mathscr{T}_{R}(A) \).}

	Let \( U \in \mathscr{T}_{A} \) then there exists an open subset \( V \subset X \) such that \( U = A \cap V \).

	From Problem~\ref{problem:III.3.6}, \( G \in \mathscr{T}_{R} \) if and only if \( x \in G \implies U_{R}(x) \in \mathscr{T}_{R} \).

	Let \( x \in U = A \cap V \). Note that \( V \in \mathscr{T}_{R} \). Apply the only if part, we deduce that
	\[
		\left\{ y \mid x \prec_{A} y \right\} = \left\{ y \mid x \prec y \right\} \cap A \in \mathscr{T}_{R}(A)
	\]

	which means \( U \in \mathscr{T}_{R}(A) \), according to the if part. Hence \( \mathscr{T}_{A} \subset \mathscr{T}_{R}(A) \).

	\textbf{Prove that \( \mathscr{T}_{R}(A) \subset \mathscr{T}_{A} \).}

	Let \( U \in \mathscr{T}_{R}(A) \) and \( x \in U \). From Problem~\ref{problem:III.3.6}, it follows that \( \left\{ y \mid x \prec_{A} y \right\} \in \mathscr{T}_{R}(A) \). Moreover
	\[
		\left\{ y \mid x \prec_{A} y \right\} = \underbrace{\left\{ y \mid x \prec y \right\}}_{\in \mathscr{T}_{R}} \cap A
	\]

	so \( \left\{ y \mid x \prec_{A} y \right\} \in \mathscr{T}_{A} \). Therefore \( U \in \mathscr{T}_{A} \), which implies \( \mathscr{T}_{R}(A) \subset \mathscr{T}_{A} \).

	Thus the two topologies are identical.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.7.10}
For any linearly ordered set \(X\), let \( \mathscr{T}_{0}(X) \) be the topology with subbasis all sets of form \( \left\{ x \mid x > a \right\}, \left\{ x \mid x < b \right\} \). In \( E^{1} \), \( \mathscr{T}_{0}(E^{1}) \) is the Euclidean topology. Let \( A = \left\{0\right\} \cup \left\{ x \mid \left\vert{x}\right\vert > 1 \right\} \). Show that its topology \( \mathscr{T}_{0}(A) \) as a linearly ordered set does not coincide with its topology as a subspace of \(E^{1}\).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Denote by \( \mathscr{T} \) the induced topology of \( A \) as a subspace of \( E^{1} \) then \( \left\{0\right\} \in \mathscr{T} \).

	If \( U \subset A \) is open and contains \( 0 \) then \( U \) is of the form
	\[
		\left\{ x \mid x > a \right\} \cup \left\{0\right\} \cup \left\{ x \mid x < b \right\} = \left\{0\right\}
	\]

	in which \( a < -1 \) and \( b > 1 \). Hence \( \left\{0\right\} \) is not open in \( \mathscr{T}_{0}(A) \).

	Thus \( \mathscr{T}_{0}(A) \ne \mathscr{T} \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.7.11}\label{problem:III.7.11}
Let \(X\) be any space, and let \(Y\) be a closed subspace. Let \(A\subset X\) by any set, and let \(H\) be a neighborhood of \( A \cap Y \) in \(Y\). Prove: \( A \cap \overline{Y - H} = \varnothing \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\( H \) is open in \( Y \) so there is an open subset \( U \subset X \) such that \( H = Y \cap U \).
	\[
		A \cap \overline{Y - H} = A \cap \overline{Y - Y \cap U} = A \cap \overline{Y - U}.
	\]

	Since \( Y - U = Y \cap (X - U) \) is closed in \(X\) (as \(Y, X - U\) are closed in \(X\)), then \( \overline{Y - U} = Y - U \). Hence
	\[
		A \cap \overline{Y - U} = A \cap (Y - U) = A \cap Y \cap (X - U).
	\]

	Besides, \( A \cap Y \subset H \subset U \) so \( A \cap Y \cap (X - U) = \varnothing \). Thus \( A \cap \overline{Y - H} = \varnothing \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.7.12}
Let \(X\) be any space, and assume that \(X = E_{1} \cup E_{2}\), where \(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\) are closed in \(X\). Let \( B \subset E_{1} \) be such that \( B \cap E_{2} \subset Q \) where \( Q \) is open in \(E_{2}\). Prove: \(B \subset \operatorname{Int}(E_{1} \cup Q)\).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	According to Problem~\ref{problem:III.7.11}, \( B \cap \overline{E_{2} - Q} = \varnothing \), from which we deduce that \( B \subset X - \overline{E_{2} - Q} \). Moreover
	\[
		X - \overline{E_{2} - Q} = \operatorname{Int}(X - (E_{2} - Q)) = \operatorname{Int}((X - E_{2}) \cup Q) \subset \operatorname{Int}(E_{1} \cup Q).
	\]

	Hence \( B \subset \operatorname{Int}(E_{1} \cup Q) \).
\end{proof}

\section{Continuous maps}

\begin{problem}{III.8.1}
Let \( \mathscr{S} \) be Sierpinski space and let \(2\) be the discrete space \( \left\{ 0, 1 \right\} \). Let \( f: \mathscr{S} \to 2 \) be the identity map. Show that \( f \) is not continuous, but that \( f^{-1}: 2 \to \mathscr{S} \) is.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	The preimage of \( \left\{ 1 \right\} \), which is open in \(2\), under \( f \) is not open in \( \mathscr{S} \) so \( f \) is not continuous.

	The preimages of \( \varnothing, \left\{ 0 \right\}, \left\{ 0, 1 \right\} \) (these are the open sets in \(\mathscr{S}\)) under \( f \) are \( \varnothing, \left\{ 0 \right\}, \left\{ 0, 1 \right\} \) and they are open in \( 2 \). Hence \( f^{-1} \) is continuous.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.8.2}
Let \(c\) be the characteristic function of \( \halfopenright{0, 1} \subset E^{1} \). Is \( c\vert_{\closedinterval{0, 1}} \) continuous at \( x = 0 \)? At \( x = 1 \)? On \( \halfopenright{0, 1} \)?
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	If \(U\) be a neighborhood at \( c(0) = 1 \) then the preimage of \(U\) under \( c\vert_{\closedinterval{0,1}} \) is \( \halfopenright{0,1} \) (if \( 0 \notin U \)) or \( \closedinterval{0, 1} \) (if \( 0 \in U \)) which are open in \( \closedinterval{0,1} \). Hence \( c\vert_{\closedinterval{0,1}} \) is continuous at \( x = 0 \).

	If \( U \) is a neighborhood at \( c(1) = 0 \) then the preimage of \(U\) under \( c\vert_{\closedinterval{0,1}} \) is
	\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt,topsep=0pt]
		\item \( \closedinterval{0,1} \) if \( 1 \in U \),
		\item \( \left\{1\right\} \) if \( 1 \notin U \).
	\end{itemize}

	So \( c\vert_{\closedinterval{0,1}} \) is not continuous at \( x = 1 \).

	Let \( x_{0} \in \halfopenright{0, 1} \). If \( U \) is a neighborhood at \( c(x_{0}) = 1 \) then the preimage of \( U \) under \( c\vert_{\closedinterval{0,1}} \) is \( \halfopenright{0,1} \) (if \( 0 \notin U \)) or \( \closedinterval{0,1} \) (if \( 0 \in U \)). Hence \( c\vert_{\closedinterval{0,1}} \) is continuous on \( \halfopenright{0,1} \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.8.3}
Let \(X\) be any space and \(c_{A}\) the characteristic function of \(A \subset X\). Show that \( c_{A}: X \to E^{1} \) is continuous if and only if \(A\) is both open and closed in \(X\).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Suppose that \( c_{A} \) is continuous. The preimage of \( \openinterval{-1/2, 1/2} \) (this is a neighborhood of \(0\) but doesn't contain \(1\)) under \( c_{A} \) is \( X - A \). The preimage of \( \openinterval{1/2, 3/2} \) (this is a neighborhood of \(1\) but doesn't contain \(0\)) under \( c_{A} \) is \( A \). Hence \( A, X - A \) are open, which means \(A\) is both open and closed in \(X\).

	Suppose that \( A \) is both open and closed in \(X\). Let \( U \) be an open set in \( E^{1} \).

	If \( 0 \notin U, 1 \notin U \) then \( c_{A}^{-1}(U) = \varnothing \) (open in \(X\)).

	If \( 0 \notin U, 1 \in U \) then \( c_{A}^{-1}(U) = A \) (open in \(X\)).

	If \( 0 \in U, 1 \notin U \) then \( c_{A}^{-1}(U) = X - A \) (open in \(X\)).

	If \( 0 \in U, 1 \in U \) then \( c_{A}^{-1}(U) = X \) (open in \(X\)).

	Hence \( c_{A} \) is continuous.

\begin{problem}{III.8.4}
Let \(C\) be the set of Section 3, Example 7.
\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
	\item Define \( \varphi: C \to E^{1} \) by \( \varphi(f) = f(1) \). Show that \( \varphi \) is continuous in the \( \mathscr{U} \) topology, but is \textit{not} continuous in the \( \mathscr{M} \) topology.
	\item Define \( \psi: C \to E^{1} \) by
	      \[
		      \psi(f) = \int_{0}^{1} f(x) dx.
	      \]

	      Show that \(\psi\) is continuous in both the \(\mathscr{M}\) and \(\mathscr{U}\) topologies.
	\item Are either of these maps continuous in the \( \mathscr{L} \) topology (Problem~\ref{problem:III.3.5})?
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
		\item Let \( \openinterval{a,b} \) be an open interval in \( E^{1} \).
		      \[
			      \varphi^{-1}(\openinterval{a,b}) = \left\{ f \in C \mid f(1) \in \openinterval{a,b} \right\}
		      \]

		      For each \( f \in \varphi^{-1}(\openinterval{a, b}) \), define \( r = \min\left\{ f(1) - a, b - f(1) \right\} \). For every \( g \in U(f, r) \)
		      \[
			      \left\vert f(1) - g(1) \right\vert \le \sup_{x} \left\vert f - g \right\vert < r
		      \]

		      so \( g(1) \in \openinterval{a,b} \), which means \( g \in \varphi^{-1}(\openinterval{a, b}) \). Hence \( U(f, r) \subset \varphi^{-1}(\openinterval{a, b}) \), so \( \varphi^{-1}(\openinterval{a, b}) \) is open in \( C \) with the \(\mathscr{U}\) topology. Therefore \( \varphi \) is continuous in the \(\mathscr{U}\) topology.

		      To show that \( \varphi \) is not continuous in the \(\mathscr{M}\) topology, we consider the open interval \( \openinterval{-1, 1} \). From the definition, the zero function \( f(x) \equiv 0 \) is an element of \( \varphi^{-1}(\openinterval{-1, 1}) \). Let \( r > 0 \), consider \( M(f, r) \).

		      Define \( f_{n}: \closedinterval{0,1} \to E^{1} \) by
		      \[
			      f_{n}(x) = \begin{cases}
				      0                & \text{if } 0 \le x < 1 - 1/n,   \\
				      rn(1 + n(x - 1)) & \text{if } 1 - 1/n \le x \le 1.
			      \end{cases}
		      \]

		      then \( f_{n} \in M(f, r) \) as \( \int_{0}^{1} \left\vert f_{n} - f \right\vert = \int_{0}^{1} \left\vert f_{n} \right\vert = \dfrac{1}{2}\cdot\dfrac{1}{n}\cdot rn = \dfrac{r}{2} < r \). However, \( f_{n}(1) = rn \) so \( f_{n}(1) \notin \varphi^{-1}(\openinterval{-1, 1}) \) whenever \( n > \dfrac{1}{r} \). Therefore \( M(f, r) \) is not contained in \( \varphi^{-1}(\openinterval{-1, 1}) \) for any \( r > 0 \), which means \( \varphi^{-1}(\openinterval{-1, 1}) \) is not open. Thus \( \varphi \) is not continuous in the \( \mathscr{M} \) topology.
		\item Let \( \openinterval{a,b} \) be an open interval in \( E^{1} \) and \( f \in \psi^{-1}(\openinterval{a,b}) \) then \( \int_{0}^{1} f \in \openinterval{a,b} \).

		      Define \( r = \min\left\{ -a + \int_{0}^{1}f, b - \int_{0}^{1}f  \right\} \) then for any \( g \in U(f, r) \), one has
		      \[
			      \int_{0}^{1}\left\vert f - g \right\vert \le \sup\limits_{x\in\closedinterval{0,1}} \left\vert f - g \right\vert < r
		      \]

		      so
		      \[
			      \left\vert \int_{0}^{1} g - \int_{0}^{1} f \right\vert \le \int_{0}^{1} \left\vert f - g \right\vert < r
		      \]

		      which means \( \int_{0}^{1} g \in \openinterval{a,b} \), so \( U(f, r) \subset \psi^{-1}(\openinterval{a, b}) \). Hence \( \psi \) is continuous in the \( \mathscr{U} \) topology.

		      On the other hand, for any \( g \in M(f, r) \)
		      \[
			      \left\vert \int_{0}^{1} g - \int_{0}^{1} f \right\vert \le \int_{0}^{1} \left\vert f - g \right\vert < r
		      \]

		      so \( \psi(g) = \int_{0}^{1} g \in \openinterval{a, b} \), which implies \( M(f, r) \subset \psi^{-1}(\openinterval{a, b}) \). Hence \( \psi \) is continuous in the \( \mathscr{M} \) topology.
		\item Let \( \openinterval{a, b} \) be an open interval in \( E^{1} \) and \( f \in \varphi^{-1}(\openinterval{a, b}) \) then \( f(1) \in \openinterval{a, b} \). Define \( \varepsilon = \min\left\{ f(1) - a, b - f(1) \right\} \) then \( U_{(x_{1} = 1, \varepsilon)}(f) \subset \varphi^{-1}(\openinterval{a, b}) \), so \( \varphi^{-1}(\openinterval{a, b}) \) is open in the \( \mathscr{L} \) topology. Hence \( \varphi \) is continuous in the \( \mathscr{L} \) topology.

		      However, \( \psi \) is not continuous in the \( \mathscr{L} \) topology. Counterexample: Let \( f \) be the zero function. Let \( x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n} \in \closedinterval{0,1} \) and \( \varepsilon > 0 \). Construct a function \( g \in C \) such that \( g(x_{i}) = f(x_{i}) \) and the graph of \( g \) has saw-tooth shape.

Under what conditions is the bijective map \( 1: (X, \mathscr{T}_{1}) \to (X, \mathscr{T}_{2}) \) not continuous, and with inverse not continuous.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	When \( \mathscr{T}_{1} \) and \( \mathscr{T}_{2} \) are not comparable then \( 1 \) is not continuous and its inverse is not continuous.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.8.6}
Let \( X \) be the space in Problem~\ref{problem:III.1.1}. State a necessary and sufficient condition that \( f: X \to X \) be continuous.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\( f: X \to X \) is continuous if and only if the preimage of any finite subset of \(X\) under \(f\) is finite.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.8.7}\label{problem:III.8.7}
Let \( X \) be the space in Problem~\ref{problem:III.1.4}. Show that \( f: X \to X \) is continuous if and only if it is order-preserving.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Suppose that \( f: X \to X \) is continuous. Let \( x, y \in X \) such that \( y \prec x \). Let \( U = \left\{ z \mid z \prec f(x) \right\} \) then \( U \) is open. Since \( f \) is continuous, then \( f^{-1}(U) \) is open. Besides, \( x \in f^{-1}(U) \) so \( y \in f^{-1}(U) \) by the definition of openness in \( X \) (see Problem~\ref{problem:III.1.4}). Hence \( f(y) \in U \), which implies \( f(y) \prec f(x) \).

	Suppose that \( f \) is order-preserving. A basis for the topology on \( X \) is
	\[
		\left\{ U_{a} \mid a \in X \right\}
	\]

	in which \( U_{a} = \left\{ x \mid x \prec a \right\} \). Since \( f \) is order-preserving, \( f^{-1}(U_{a}) \) is also a basic open set for each \( a \in X \) (here I make use of the anti-symmetry of \( \prec \)). Therefore \( f \) is continuous.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.8.8}
Let \( \mathbb{Z}^{+} \) be taken with the topology of Problem~\ref{problem:III.1.5}. Show that \( f: \mathbb{Z}^{+} \to \mathbb{Z}^{+} \) is continuous if and only if \( (m \text{ divides } n) \implies (f(m) \text{ divides } f(n)) \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Divisibility is an order relation on \( \mathbb{Z}^{+} \) so according to Problem~\ref{problem:III.8.7}, \( f: \mathbb{Z}^{+} \to \mathbb{Z}^{+} \) is continuous if and only if \( f \) preserves divisibility.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.8.9}
Let \( X \) be the set of Problem~\ref{problem:III.3.6}, with topology \( \mathscr{T}_{R} \). Derive a necessary and sufficient condition for continuity of \( f: X \to X \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	The open sets in \( X \) are characterized by the following property: \( U \in \mathscr{T}_{R} \) if and only if \( x \in U \land (y \prec x) \implies y \in U \). According to Problem~\ref{problem:III.8.7}, \( f: X \to X \) is continuous if and only if \( f \) is order-preserving.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.8.10}
Prove that the following three statements are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
	\item \( f: X \to Y \) is continuous.
	\item \( f(A^{\prime}) \subset \overline{f(A)} \) for each \( A \subset X \).
	\item \( \operatorname{Fr}\left\lbrack f^{-1}(B) \right\rbrack \subset f^{-1}\left\lbrack \operatorname{Fr}(B) \right\rbrack \) for each \( B \subset Y \).
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	(a) \( \implies \) (b) Let \( y \in f(A^{\prime}) \) then there exists \( x \in A^{\prime} \) such that \( f(x) = y \). For every neighborhood \( U \) of \( f(x) \), \( f^{-1}(U) \) is open and a neighborhood of \( x \), so \( f^{-1}(U) \) intersects \( A - \left\{ x \right\} \) as \( x \) is a cluster point of \( A \). Moreover \( f(f^{-1}(U)) \subset U \) and \( f(A - \left\{x\right\}) \subset f(A) \) so \( U \) intersects \( f(A) \). Hence \( y = f(x) \in \overline{f(A)} \), which means \( f(A^{\prime}) \subset \overline{f(A)} \) for each \( A \subset X \).

	(b) \( \implies \) (a) For each \( A \subset X \), \( f(A^{\prime}) \subset \overline{f(A)} \) so
	\[
		f(\overline{A}) = f(A \cup A^{\prime}) = f(A) \cup f(A^{\prime}) \subset \overline{f(A)} \cup \overline{f(A)} = \overline{f(A)}.
	\]

	Hence \( f \) is continuous.

	(a) \( \implies \) (c) For each \( B \subset Y \), \( f^{-1}(\overline{B}) \) is closed in \( X \) as \( f \) is continuous and \( \overline{B} \) is closed in \( Y \). Since \( B \subset \overline{B} \) then \( f^{-1}(B) \subset f^{-1}(\overline{B}) \). Moreover, \( \overline{f^{-1}(B)} \) is the intersection of all closed sets containing \( f^{-1}(B) \) so \( \overline{f^{-1}(B)} \subset f^{-1}(\overline{B}) \). Hence
	\begingroup
	\allowdisplaybreaks%
	\begin{align*}
		\operatorname{Fr}\left\lbrack f^{-1}(B) \right\rbrack & = \overline{f^{-1}(B)} \cap \overline{f^{-1}(Y - B)}       \\
		                                                      & \subset f^{-1}(\overline{B}) \cap f^{-1}(\overline{Y - B}) \\
		                                                      & = f^{-1}(\overline{B} \cap \overline{Y - B})               \\
		                                                      & = f^{-1}\left\lbrack \operatorname{Fr}(B) \right\rbrack.
	\end{align*}
	\endgroup

	(c) \( \implies \) (a) Let \( B \) be a closed set in \( Y \) then \( B = \overline{B} \) and
	\[
		\operatorname{Fr}\left\lbrack f^{-1}(B) \right\rbrack \subset f^{-1}\left\lbrack \operatorname{Fr}(B) \right\rbrack \subset f^{-1}(\overline{B}) = f^{-1}(B)
	\]

	so \( f^{-1}(B) \) contains all of its boundary points, which implies \( f^{-1}(B) \) is closed in \(X\). Hence \( f \) is continuous.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.8.11}
Let \( X = X_{1} \cup X_{2} \) and \( f: X \to Y \). Assume \( f\vert_{X_{1}} \) and \( f\vert_{X_{2}} \) to be continuous at \( x \in X_{1} \cap X_{2} \). Show that \( f \) is continuous at \( x \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Let \( V \) be a neighborhood of \( f(x) \) then there exist a neighborhood \( U_{1} \) of \( x \) in \( X_{1} \) such that \( f(U_{1}) \subset V \) and a neighborhood \( U_{2} \) of \( x \) in \( X_{2} \) such that \( f(U_{2}) \subset V \).

	\( U_{1} = W_{1} \cap X_{1} \) for some open set \( W_{1} \subset X \) and \( U_{2} = W_{2} \cap X_{2} \) for some open set \( W_{2} \subset X \). Let \( U = W_{1} \cap W_{2} \) then \( U \) is a neighborhood of \( x \).

	Let \( t \in U \). The point \( t \) is in \( X_{1} \) or \( X_{2} \) as their union is \( X \). If \( t \in X_{1} \) then \( t \in W_{1} \cap X_{1} = U_{1} \), so \( f(t) \in f(U_{1}) \subset V \). If \( t \in X_{2} \) then \( t \in W_{2} \cap X_{2} = U_{2} \), so \( f(t) \in f(U_{2}) \subset V \). Hence \( f(U) \subset V \).

	Thus \( f \) is continuous at \( x \).

Let \( f: X \to Y \) be a map and \( A \subseteq X \). Give an example showing \( f\vert_{A} \) continuous, although \( f \) is not continuous at any point of \( A \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Let \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) be the Dirichlet function, which means \( f \) is the indicator function of \( \mathbb{Q} \) in \( \mathbb{R} \). Then \( f\vert_{\mathbb{Q}} \) is continuous as it is a constant function but \( f \) is not continuous at any point of \( \mathbb{Q} \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.8.13}
Let \( f: X \to Y \) be continuous. If \( B \subseteq Y \) is a \( G_{\delta} \) (resp. \( F_{\sigma} \)), show that \( f^{-1}(B) \) is also a \( G_{\delta} \) (resp. \( F_{\sigma} \)).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	If \( B \) is a \( G_{\delta} \) set then \( B = \bigcap^{\infty}_{n=1} G_{n} \) in which each \( G_{n} \) is open in \( Y \). Because
	\[
		f^{-1}(B) = f^{-1}\left( \bigcap^{\infty}_{n=1} G_{n} \right) = \bigcap^{\infty}_{n=1} f^{-1}(G_{n})
	\]

	and \( f \) is continuous, then \( f^{-1}(B) \) is also a \( G_{\delta} \) set.

	If \( B \) is a \( F_{\delta} \) set then \( B = \bigcup^{\infty}_{n=1} F_{n} \) in which each \( F_{n} \) is closed in \( Y \). Because
	\[
		f^{-1}(B) = f^{-1}\left( \bigcup^{\infty}_{n=1} F_{n} \right) = \bigcup^{\infty}_{n=1} f^{-1}(F_{n})
	\]

	and \( f \) is continuous, then \( f^{-1}(B) \) is also a \( F_{\delta} \) set.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.8.14}
Construct an example of a map \( f: X \times X \to E^{1} \) continuous in each variable separately but not continuous on \( X \times X \) (use \( X = E^{1} \) for simplicity).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\[
		f(x, y) = \begin{cases}
			\dfrac{xy}{x^{2} + y^{2}} & (x, y) \ne (0, 0) \\
			0                         & (x, y) = (0, 0)
		\end{cases}
	\]

	then \( x \mapsto f(x, y) \) and \( y \mapsto f(x, y) \) are continuous but \( f \) is not continuous.
\end{proof}

\section{Piecewise definition of maps}

\begin{problem}{III.9.1}\label{problem:III.9.1}
Let \( \left\{ A_{\lambda} \right\} \) be a nbd-finite closed covering of \(X\). Let \( x_{0} \in X \), and for each set \( A_{\lambda_{i}} (i = 1, \ldots, n) \) containing \( x_{0} \), let \( V_{i} \) be a nbd of \( x_{0} \) in \( A_{\lambda_{i}} \). Show that \( \bigcup^{n}_{1} V_{i} \) contains a nbd of \( x_{0} \) in \( X \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\( V_{i} \) is open in \( A_{\lambda_{i}} \) so there exists an open subset \( U_{i} \subset X \) such that \( V_{i} = A_{\lambda_{i}} \cap U_{i} \).
	\[
		B = \bigcup_{\lambda \ne \lambda_{1}, \ldots, \lambda_{n}} A_{\lambda}
	\]

	is closed as \( \left\{ A_{\lambda} \mid \lambda \ne \lambda_{1}, \ldots, \lambda_{n} \right\} \) is nbd-finite and each \( A_{\lambda} \) is closed. So \( X - B \) is open and a neighborhood of \( x_{0} \) and \( X - B \subset \bigcup^{n}_{1} A_{\lambda_{i}} \).

	Let \( W = (X - B) \cap \bigcap^{n}_{1} U_{i} \) then \( W \) is open and a neighborhood of \( x_{0} \). If \( x \in W \) then \( x \in X - B \subset \bigcup^{n}_{1} A_{\lambda_{i}} \), which means \( x \in A_{\lambda_{j}} \) for some \( j \). Moreover, \( x \in W \subset \bigcap^{n}_{1} U_{i} \) so \( x \in U_{j} \). Therefore \( x \in U_{j} \cap A_{j} = V_{j} = \bigcup^{n}_{1} V_{i} \), which means \( W \subset \bigcup^{n}_{1} V_{i} \).

	Thus \( W \) is a neighborhood of \( x_{0} \) which is contained in \( \bigcup^{n}_{1} V_{i} \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.9.2}
Let \(X\) be any space, and \( \left\{ A_{n} \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \right\} \) a family of sets in \(X\) such that \( A_{n} \supset A_{n+1} \) for each \( n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \). Prove that, if \( \bigcap^{\infty}_{1} \overline{A_{n}} = \varnothing \), then the family \( \left\{ A_{n} \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \right\} \) is nbd-finite.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\( \bigcap^{\infty}_{1} \overline{A_{n}} = \varnothing \iff \bigcup^{\infty}_{1} \mathscr{C}\overline{A_{n}} = \mathscr{C}\varnothing = X \).

	Let \( x \) be a point in \( X \). Since \( \bigcup^{\infty}_{1} \mathscr{C}\overline{A_{n}} = X \), there exists a smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( x \in \mathscr{C}\overline{A_{n}} \). Because \( \mathscr{C}\overline{A_{n}} \subset \mathscr{C}\overline{A_{m}} \) for every positive integer \( m \ge n \) then \( \mathscr{C}\overline{A_{n}} \cap \overline{A_{m}} = \varnothing \) for every positive integer \( m \ge n \). Therefore, if \( \mathscr{C}\overline{A_{n}} \cap \overline{A_{m}} \ne \varnothing \) then \( 0 < m < n \), which means \( \left\{ \overline{A_{n}} \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \right\} \) is nbd-finite. Consequently, \( \left\{ A_{n} \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \right\} \) is nbd-finite.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.9.3}
Prove:
\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
	\item Any open set in \(E^{1}\) is the union of a pairwise disjoint family of open intervals. Give an example to show that this is not true for \( E^{n}, n > 1 \), if ``open intervals'' is replaced by ``open cubes.\@''
	\item Any open set in \( E^{n} \) is the union of at most countably many nonoverlapping closed cubes.
	\item Show that a non-empty open set in \( E^{n} \) \textcolor{red}{(other than \( \mathbb{R}^{n} \))} cannot be the union of nbd-finite family of nonoverlapping closed cubes.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
		\item Let \( S \) be an open set in \( E^{1} \) and \( x \) a point in \( S \). There exists an open interval that contains \( x \) and is contained in \( S \). Let \( U_{x} \) be the union of all such open intervals then \( x \in U_{x} \) then \( U_{x} \) is a neighborhood of \( x \). Suppose that \( a < b \) and \( a, b \in U_{x} \).

		      From the definition of \( U_{x} \), there exist open intervals \( \openinterval{a_{1}, a_{2}}, \openinterval{b_{1}, b_{2}} \) such that \( a, x \in \openinterval{a_{1}, a_{2}} \) and \( b, x \in \openinterval{b_{1}, b_{2}} \) then \( \openinterval{a, b} \subset \openinterval{a_{1}, a_{2}} \cup \openinterval{b_{1}, b_{2}} \subset U_{x} \). Hence \( U_{x} \) is an interval. Since \( U_{x} \) is open then it is of the form \( \openinterval{a, b}, \openinterval{a, \infty}, \openinterval{-\infty, b} \), or \( \mathbb{R} \). Each element \( x \) of \( S \) is contained in a maximal interval that is also an open set. Assume that \( U_{x} \cap U_{y} \ne \varnothing \) then \( U_{x} \cup U_{y} \) is an interval that is open. Due to the maximality of \( U_{x}, U_{y} \), it follows that \( U_{x} = U_{y} \). Hence \( S \) is the union of disjoint open intervals.

		      For \( n > 1 \), the open ball \( B(0; 1) \) is not a union of pairwise disjoint open cubes. A direct proof for this makes use of connectedness, which is not covered in this chapter.
		\item Let \(G\) be an open set in \( E^{n} \).

		      In \( E^{n} \), let \( H_{k} \) be the grid formed by all the lines of the forms \( x_{1} = p_{1}/2^{k}, \ldots, x_{n} = p_{n}/2^{k} \) in which \( p_{1}, \ldots, p_{n} \in \mathbb{Z} \).

		      Inductively, we define
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item \( S_{1} \) is the union of closed cubes whose side lengths equal \( 1/2 \), vertices in \( H_{1} \) and these closed cubes are contained in \( G \).
			      \item \( S_{n+1} \) is the union of closed cubes whose side lengths equal \( 1/2^{n+1} \), vertices in \( H_{n+1} \) and these closed cubes are contained in \( G - \bigcup^{n}_{1}S_{i} \).
		      \end{itemize}

		      From this construction, we deduce that \( \bigcup^{\infty}_{1} S_{i} \subset G \).

		      Suppose that \( a = (a^{1}, \ldots, a^{n}) \in G \). There exists \( \delta > 0 \) such that \( B(a, \delta) \subset G \). Moreover, there exists a positive integer \(m\) such that \( \dfrac{\sqrt{n}}{2^{m}} \) (namely, the diameter of a closed cube in \(H_{m}\)) is strictly less than \( \delta \). There exists a closed cube in \(H_{m}\) that contains \( a \) and this closed cube is contained in \( B(x, \delta) \). Hence there is a positive integer \( m \) for which there exists a closed cube in \( H_{m} \) that contains \( a \) and is contained in \( G \).

		      From the well-ordering principle, there is a minimal positive integer \( m_{0} \) such that there exists a closed cube in \( H_{m_{0}} \) that contains \( a \) and is contained in \( G \). Hence \( a \notin \bigcup^{m_{0} - 1}_{1} S_{i} \) but \( a \in \bigcup^{m_{0}}_{1} S_{i} \). Since we are working with an arbitrary point \( a \in G \), we conclude that \( G \subset \bigcup^{\infty}_{1} S_{i} \).

		      Thus \( G = \bigcup^{\infty}_{1} S_{i} \), which means \( G \) is the union of countably many nonoverlapping closed cubes.
		\item Assume for the sake of contrary that there is a non-empty open set \( U \) in \( E^{n} \) other than \( \mathbb{R}^{n} \) that is the union of nbd-finite family \( \mathscr{H} \) of nonoverlapping closed cubes. Since \( \mathscr{H} \) is nbd-finite and each member is closed, then
		      \[
			      \overline{U} = \overline{\bigcup_{H \in \mathscr{H}} H} = \bigcup_{H \in \mathscr{H}} \overline{H} = \bigcup_{H \in \mathscr{H}} H = U
		      \]

		      which means \( U \) is open and closed. Due to the connectedness of the Euclidean space, \( \varnothing, \mathbb{R}^{n} \) are the only two subsets that are both open and closed.

		      Thus there is no open set other than \( \varnothing, \mathbb{R}^{n} \) that can be the union of of nbd-finite family of nonoverlapping closed cubes.

\begin{problem}{III.10.1}
Let \( f: X \to E^{1} \) be such that for each rational \(r\), \( \left\{ x \mid f(x) > r \right\} \) is open. Show that \(f\) is lower semicontinuous.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\( \left\lceil \cdot \right\rceil \) denotes the ceiling function.

	Let \( b \) be a real number. The sequence \( {\left\{ a_{n} \right\}}_{n\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}} \), in which \( a_{n} = \dfrac{\left\lceil nb \right\rceil}{n} \), converges to \( b \). Moreover, \( b = \inf\limits_{n} \dfrac{\left\lceil nb \right\rceil}{n} \).

	If \( b \) is rational, then \( \left\{ x \mid f(x) > b \right\} \) is open by the hypothesis. If \( b \) is irrational, we rewrite \( \left\{ x \mid f(x) > b \right\} \) as
	\[
		\left\{ x \mid f(x) > b \right\} = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}} \left\{ x \mid f(x) > a_{n} \right\}
	\]

	so \( \left\{ x \mid f(x) > b \right\} \) is also open when \( b \) is irrational.

	Thus \( \left\{ x \mid f(x) > b \right\} \) for any real number \( b \), which means \( f \) is lower semicontinuous.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.10.2}
Let \( \mathscr{M} \) be a family of sets in \(X\) closed under countable unions and finite intersections. Call \(f: X \to E^{1} \) an \( \mathscr{M} \)-function if \( f^{-1}(U) \in \mathscr{M} \) for each subbasic \( U \) of \( E^{1} \). Show that \textbf{10.3} is true, with ``continuous'' replaced by ``\( \mathscr{M} \)-function.\@''
\end{problem}

\begin{quote}
	The following is \textbf{10.3} with ``continuous'' replaced by ``\( \mathscr{M} \)-function.

	Let \( f, g: X \to E^{1} \) be \( \mathscr{M} \)-functions, then
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\arabic*)}]
		\item \( {\left\vert f \right\vert}^{\alpha} \) is a \( \mathscr{M} \)-function for each \( \alpha \ge 0 \).
		\item \( af + bg \) is a \( \mathscr{M} \)-function for each pair of real constants, \( a, b \).
		\item \( f\cdot g \) is a \( \mathscr{M} \)-function.
		\item If \( f(x) \ne 0 \) on \(X\), then \( 1/f \) is a \( \mathscr{M} \)-function.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\arabic*)}]
		\item If \( b < 0 \) then \( \left\{ x \mid {\left\vert f(x) \right\vert}^{\alpha} > b \right\} = X \in \mathscr{M} \) (the intersection of the empty collection) and \( \left\{ x \mid {\left\vert f(x) \right\vert}^{\alpha} < b \right\} = \varnothing \in \mathscr{M} \) (the union of the empty collection).

		      If \( b \ge 0 \) then
		      \begingroup
		      \allowdisplaybreaks%
		      \begin{align*}
			      \left\{ x \mid {\left\vert f(x) \right\vert}^{\alpha} > b \right\} & = \left\{ x \mid f(x) > b^{1/\alpha} \right\} \cup \left\{ x \mid f(x) < -b^{1/\alpha} \right\} \in \mathscr{M} \\
			      \left\{ x \mid {\left\vert f(x) \right\vert}^{\alpha} < b \right\} & = \left\{ x \mid f(x) < b^{1/\alpha} \right\} \cap \left\{ x \mid f(x) > -b^{1/\alpha} \right\} \in \mathscr{M}
		      \end{align*}
		      \endgroup

		      since \( f \) is a \( \mathscr{M} \)-function. Hence \( {\left\vert f \right\vert}^{\alpha} \) is a \( \mathscr{M} \)-function.
		\item If \( a = 0 \) then \( af \) is a \( \mathscr{M} \)-function.

		      If \( a > 0 \) then
		      \begingroup
		      \allowdisplaybreaks%
		      \begin{align*}
			      \left\{ x \mid af(x) > c \right\} & = \left\{ x \mid f(x) > c/a \right\} \in \mathscr{M}, \\
			      \left\{ x \mid af(x) < c \right\} & = \left\{ x \mid f(x) < c/a \right\} \in \mathscr{M}.
		      \end{align*}
		      \endgroup

		      If \( a < 0 \) then
		      \begingroup
		      \allowdisplaybreaks%
		      \begin{align*}
			      \left\{ x \mid af(x) > c \right\} & = \left\{ x \mid f(x) < c/a \right\} \in \mathscr{M}, \\
			      \left\{ x \mid af(x) < c \right\} & = \left\{ x \mid f(x) > c/a \right\} \in \mathscr{M}.
		      \end{align*}
		      \endgroup

		      So \( af \) is a \( \mathscr{M} \)-function for every real number \( a \).

		      Now we will show that
		      \[
			      \left\{ x \mid f(x) + g(x) > c \right\} = \bigcup_{\lambda \in \mathbb{Q}} \left( \left\{ x \mid f(x) > \lambda \right\} \cap \left\{ x \mid g(x) > c - \lambda \right\} \right).
		      \]

		      Evidently
		      \[
			      \bigcup_{\lambda \in \mathbb{Q}} \left( \left\{ x \mid f(x) > \lambda \right\} \cap \left\{ x \mid g(x) > c - \lambda \right\} \right) \subset \left\{ x \mid f(x) + g(x) > c \right\}.
		      \]

		      Let \( x \in \left\{ x \mid f(x) + g(x) > c \right\} \) then \( f(x) + g(x) = c + \delta \) for some \( \delta > 0 \). There exists a rational number \( \lambda \in \openinterval{f(x) - \delta, f(x)} \), so \( g(x) = c + \delta - f(x) > c - \lambda \). Hence \( f(x) > \lambda \) and \( g(x) > c - \lambda \). Because \( x \) is an arbitrary element of \(  \left\{ x \mid f(x) + g(x) > c \right\} \), we conclude that
		      \[
			      \left\{ x \mid f(x) + g(x) > c \right\} \subset \bigcup_{\lambda \in \mathbb{Q}} \left( \left\{ x \mid f(x) > \lambda \right\} \cap \left\{ x \mid g(x) > c - \lambda \right\} \right).
		      \]

		      Hence
		      \[
			      \left\{ x \mid f(x) + g(x) > c \right\} = \bigcup_{\lambda \in \mathbb{Q}} \underbrace{\left( \left\{ x \mid f(x) > \lambda \right\} \cap \left\{ x \mid g(x) > c - \lambda \right\} \right)}_{\in \mathscr{M}}.
		      \]

		      So \( \left\{ x \mid f(x) + g(x) > c \right\} \in \mathscr{M} \) for every real number \( c \). Analogously, \( \left\{ x \mid f(x) + g(x) < c \right\} \in \mathscr{M} \) for every real number \( c \). Hence \( f + g \) is a \( \mathscr{M} \)-function.

		      Thus \( af + bg \) is a \( \mathscr{M} \)-function for any real numbers \( a, b \).
		\item \( (f\cdot g)(x) = f(x)g(x) = {\left\vert f(x) + g(x) \right\vert}^{2} - {\left\vert f(x) - g(x) \right\vert}^{2} \) so \( f\cdot g \) is a \( \mathscr{M} \)-function.
		\item For every real number \( b \)
		      \[
			      \left\{ x \mid 1/f(x) > b \right\} = (\left\{ x \mid f(x) > 0 \right\} \cap \left\{ x \mid bf(x) < 1 \right\}) \cup (\left\{ x \mid f(x) < 0 \right\} \cap \left\{ x \mid bf(x) > 1 \right\})
		      \]

		      so \( \left\{ x \mid 1/f(x) > b \right\} \in \mathscr{M} \). Analogously, \( \left\{ x \mid 1/f(x) > b \right\} \in \mathscr{M} \). Thus \( 1/f \) is a \( \mathscr{M} \)-function.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.10.3}
Let \(E\) be the space of real numbers with subbasis all sets of form \( \left\{ x \mid x > b \right\} \). Prove \( f: X \to E \) is continuous if and only if \(f\) is lower semicontinuous, as a map into \( E^{1} \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\( f: X \to E \) is continuous if and only if \( \left\{ x \mid f(x) > b \right\} \) is open in \( X \) for every real number \( b \).

	\( f: X \to E^{1} \) is lower semicontinuous if and only if \( \left\{ x \mid f(x) > b \right\} \) is open in \( X \) for every real number \( b \).

	Hence  \( f: X \to E \) is continuous if and only if \( f: X \to E^{1} \) is lower semicontinuous.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.10.4}\label{problem:III.10.4}
Show that the sum, inf of finitely many, and sup of an arbitrary family, of lower semicontinuous is lower semicontinuous. Show that if \( f, g \) are \( \ge 0 \) and lower semicontinuous, so also is \( f \cdot g \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\textbf{Sum of finitely many lower semicontinuous is lower semicontinuous.}

	Let \( f, g \) be lower-semicontinuous functions, then for every real number \( b \)
	\[
		\left\{ x \mid f(x) + g(x) > b \right\} = \bigcup_{\lambda \in \mathbb{R}} (\left\{ x \mid f(x) > \lambda \right\} \cap \left\{ x \mid g(x) > b - \lambda \right\})
	\]

	So \( \left\{ x \mid f(x) + g(x) > b \right\} \) is open for every real number \( b \), which means \( f + g \) is lower semi-continuous.

	By mathematical induction, we can prove that the sum of finitely many lower semicontinuous is lower semicontinuous.

	\textbf{Inf of finitely many lower semicontinuous is lower semicontinuous.}

	Let \( f_{1}, \ldots, f_{n} \) be lower-semicontinuous functions and \( f(x) = \inf\left\{ f_{1}(x), \ldots, f_{n}(x) \right\} \). For every real number \( b \)
	\[
		\left\{ x \mid f(x) > b \right\} = \bigcap^{n}_{i=1} \left\{ x \mid f_{i}(x) > b \right\}
	\]

	is open so \( f \) is lower semicontinuous.

	\textbf{Sup of an arbitrary family of lower semicontinuous is lower semicontinuous.}

	Let \( {(f_{\alpha})}_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \) be a family of lower semicontinuous and \( f(x) = \sup_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}}\left\{ f_{\alpha}(x)  \right\} \) then
	\[
		\left\{ x \mid f(x) > b \right\} = \bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \left\{ x \mid f_{\alpha}(x) > b \right\}
	\]

	so \( f \) is lower semicontinuous.

	\textbf{If \( f, g \) are nonnegative and lower semicontinuous then also is \( f\cdot g \).}

	\( f\cdot g \) is also nonnegative. If \( b < 0 \) then
	\[
		\left\{ x \mid f(x)g(x) > b \right\} = X.
	\]

	If \( b = 0 \) then
	\[
		\left\{ x \mid f(x)g(x) > 0 \right\} = \left\{ x \mid f(x) > 0 \right\} \cap \left\{ x \mid g(x) > 0 \right\}.
	\]

	If \( b > 0 \), let \( x \in \left\{ x \mid f(x)g(x) > b \right\} \) then \( f(x)g(x) = bc \) in which \( c > 1 \). Let \( \lambda > 0 \) be a number such that \( f(x)/c < \lambda < f(x) \) then \( g(x) = bc/f(x) > b/\lambda \). Therefore
	\[
		\left\{ x \mid f(x)g(x) > b \right\} \subset \bigcup_{\lambda \in \mathbb{R}_{> 0}} (\left\{ x \mid f(x) > \lambda \right\} \cap \left\{ x \mid g(x) > b/\lambda \right\})
	\]

	and
	\[
		\left\{ x \mid f(x)g(x) > b \right\} \supset \bigcup_{\lambda \in \mathbb{R}_{> 0}} (\left\{ x \mid f(x) > \lambda \right\} \cap \left\{ x \mid g(x) > b/\lambda \right\}).
	\]

	So \( \left\{ x \mid f(x)g(x) > b \right\} = \bigcup_{\lambda \in \mathbb{R}_{> 0}} (\left\{ x \mid f(x) > \lambda \right\} \cap \left\{ x \mid g(x) > b/\lambda \right\}) \).

	Thus \( f\cdot g \) is lower semicontinuous.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.10.5}
Prove: \(f\) is lower semicontinuous if and only if:
\[
	\forall \varepsilon > 0\; \forall x_{0}\; \exists U(x_{0}): x \in U(x_{0}) \implies f(x) > f(x_{0}) - \varepsilon
\]

\(f\) is upper semicontinuous if and only if:
\[
	\forall \varepsilon > 0\; \forall x_{0}\; \exists U(x_{0}): x \in U(x_{0}) \implies f(x) < f(x_{0}) + \varepsilon
\]

Equivalently, \(f\) is lower (upper) semicontinuous if and only if for each real \(b\), \( \left\{ x \mid f(x) \le b \right\} \) (\( \left\{ x \mid f(x) \ge b \right\} \)) is closed.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Suppose that \( f \) is lower semicontinuous.

	For every \( \varepsilon > 0 \) and every \( x_{0} \in X \), \( \left\{ x \mid f(x) > f(x_{0}) - \varepsilon \right\} \) is open. Since \( x_{0} \in \left\{ x \mid f(x) > f(x_{0}) - \varepsilon \right\} \) then there is a neighborhood \( U(x_{0}) \) of \( x_{0} \) such that \( U(x_{0}) \subset \left\{ x \mid f(x) > f(x_{0}) - \varepsilon \right\} \). Hence
	\[
		\forall \varepsilon > 0\; \forall x_{0}\; \exists U(x_{0}): x \in U(x_{0}) \implies f(x) > f(x_{0}) - \varepsilon.
	\]

	Conversely, suppose that \( \forall \varepsilon > 0\; \forall x_{0}\; \exists U(x_{0}): x \in U(x_{0}) \implies f(x) > f(x_{0}) - \varepsilon \).

	Let \( b \) be a real number and \( U_{b} = \left\{ x \mid f(x) > b \right\} \). For each \( x_{0} \in U_{b} \), \( f(x_{0}) > b \). Let \( \varepsilon = f(x_{0}) - b \) then \( U_{b} = \left\{ x \mid f(x) > f(x_{0}) - \varepsilon \right\} \) so according to the hypothesis, there is a neighborhood of \( x_{0} \) that is contained in \( U_{b} \). Hence \( U_{b} \) is open for every real number \(b\). Hence \( f \) is lower semicontinuous.

	\bigskip
	\(f\) is upper semicontinuous iff \( -f \) is lower semicontinuous, and \( -f \) is lower semicontinuous iff
	\[
		\forall \varepsilon > 0\; \forall x_{0}\; \exists U(x_{0}): x \in U(x_{0}) \implies -f(x) > -f(x_{0}) - \varepsilon
	\]

	equivalently,
	\[
		\forall \varepsilon > 0\; \forall x_{0}\; \exists U(x_{0}): x \in U(x_{0}) \implies f(x) < f(x_{0}) + \varepsilon.
	\]

	\bigskip
	\( f \) is lower (upper) semicontinuous iff for each real number \(b\), \( \left\{ x \mid f(x) > b \right\} \) (\( \left\{ x \mid f(x) < b \right\} \)) is open. Equivalently, \(  \left\{ x \mid f(x) \le b \right\} = X - \left\{ x \mid f(x) > b \right\} \) (\( \left\{ x \mid f(x) \ge b \right\} = X - \left\{ x \mid f(x) < b \right\} \)) is closed.

\begin{problem}{III.10.6}
Let \(C^{1}\) be the set of all continuous real-valued functions on \( \closedinterval{0,1} \) that have a continuous derivative on \( \closedinterval{0,1} \). Let \( \mathscr{T} \) be the topology having
\[
	U_{\varepsilon}(f) = \left\{ g \mid \forall x: \left\vert g(x) - f(x) \right\vert < \varepsilon \right\}

Show that \( \ell: C^{1} \to E^{1} \) is lower semicontinuous.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\( \mathscr{T} \) is a metric space, in which the metric function \( d \) is \( d(f, g) = \max\limits_{x\in\closedinterval{0,1}} \left\vert f(x) - g(x) \right\vert \). We can use \( \max \) instead of \( \sup \) due to the extremum value theorem.

	\( \ell(f) = \sup\limits_{P} \ell_{P}(f) \) in which each \( P \) is a partition of \( \closedinterval{0,1} \) into finitely many nonoverlapping closed intervals. If \( P \) is determined by \( x_{0} = 0 < x_{1} < \cdots < x_{n-1} < x_{n} = 1 \) then
	\[
		\ell_{P}(f) = \sum^{n-1}_{i=0} \left\vert f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_{i}) \right\vert.
	\]

	Let's show that each function \( \Delta: C^{1} \to E^{1} \) given by \( \Delta(f) = \left\vert f(x) - f(y) \right\vert \) for some \( x, y \in \closedinterval{0,1} \) is continuous. For every \( \varepsilon > 0 \), for every \( f, g \in C^{1} \) such that \( d(f, g) < \varepsilon/2 \), then
	\begingroup
	\allowdisplaybreaks%
	\begin{align*}
		\left\vert \Delta(f) - \Delta(g) \right\vert & = \left\vert \left\vert f(x) - f(y) \right\vert - \left\vert g(x) - g(y) \right\vert \right\vert \\

	\endgroup

	So \( \Delta \) is continuous, which implies \( \ell_{P} \) is continuous, because the sum of finitely many continuous is continuous. Hence \( \ell_{P} \) is lower semicontinuous.

	Each \( \ell_{P} \) is lower semicontinuous (because they are continuous) so \( \ell \) is lower semicontinuous, according to Problem~\ref{problem:III.10.4} (sup of an arbitrary family of lower semicontinuous is lower semicontinuous).

Let \( \left\{ f_{n} \right\} \) be a sequence of continuous real-valued functions on a space \(X\). Show that the set of points \( x \in X \) for which the sequence \( \left\{ f_{n}(x) \right\} \) converges is an \( F_{\sigma\delta} \) (that is, a countable intersection of \( F_{\sigma} \)-sets).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Let \( S \) be the set of points \( x \in X \) for which the sequence \( \left\{ f_{n}(x) \right\} \) converges.
	\begingroup

	The set \( \left\{ x \mid \left\vert f_{m}(x) - f_{n}(x) \right\vert \le 1/k \right\} = \left\{ x \mid \left\vert (f_{m} - f_{n})(x) \right\vert \le 1/k \right\} \) is closed as it is the preimage of \( \closedinterval{-1/k, 1/k} \) under the continuous function \( f_{m} - f_{n} \). Therefore
	\[
		\bigcap_{m, n > N} \left\{ x \mid \left\vert f_{m}(x) - f_{n}(x) \right\vert \le 1/k \right\}

	is closed. Hence
	\[
		S = \underbrace{\bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}} \underbrace{\bigcup_{N \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}} \underbrace{\bigcap_{m, n > N} \left\{ x \mid \left\vert f_{m}(x) - f_{n}(x) \right\vert \le 1/k \right\}}_{\text{closed}}}_{F_{\sigma}}}_{F_{\sigma\delta}}

	which means \( S \) is a \( F_{\sigma\delta} \) set.

	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
		\item Let \( U \) be an open set in \( E^{1} \times E^{1} \). For each \( (x, y) \in U \), there are open sets \( U_{1}, U_{2} \) in \( E^{1} \) such that \( (x, y) \in U_{1} \times U_{2} \subset U \). Hence \( p(x, y) \in p(U_{1} \times U_{2}) = U_{1} \subset p(U) \), which means \( p \) is an open map.

		\item The image of the closed set \( \left\{ (x, y) \mid xy = 1 \right\} \) under \(p\) is \( \mathbb{R} - \left\{0\right\} \), which is not closed in \( E^{1} \), as its closure is \( \mathbb{R} \). Hence \(p\) is not a closed map.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.11.2}
Let \( p(x) \) be a polynomial on \(E^{1}\). Show that \( x \mapsto p(x) \) is a closed map of \( E^{1} \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	If \( p(x) \) is a constant polynomial function then the image of any \( A \subset \mathbb{R} \) is a singleton, which is closed in \( E^{1} \).

	Suppose that \( p(x) \) is a nonconstant polynomial function and \( F \) is a closed set in \( E^{1} \). Let \( y \in \overline{p(F)} \) then there exists a sequence of points in \( p(F) \) that converges to \( y \). So there is a sequence \( \left\{ x_{n} \right\} \) in \( F \) such that \( \left\{ p(x_{n}) \right\} \) converges to \( y \). If \( \left\{ x_{n} \right\} \) is unbounded then \( \left\{ p(x_{n}) \right\} \) is unbounded (because \( \lim\limits_{x\to\pm\infty} \left\vert p(x) \right\vert = \infty \)). On the other hand, \( \left\{ p(x_{n}) \right\} \) is bounded as it is convergent, so \( \left\{ x_{n} \right\} \) is bounded. According to Bolzano-Weierstra\ss's theorem, \( \left\{ x_{n} \right\} \) contains a convergent subsequence. Let's choose a convergent subsequence \( \left\{ x_{k(n)} \right\} \). Since \( F \) is closed, it follows that the limit \( x \) of \( \left\{ x_{k(n)} \right\} \) is in \( F \). Since \( p \) is continuous, \( p(x) = \lim\limits_{n\to\infty} p(x_{k(n)}) = y \), which means \( y \in p(F) \). Thus \( \overline{p(F)} = p(F) \), which implies \( p(F) \) is closed for every closed set \( F \) in \( E^{1} \).

	Thus \( p \) is a closed map.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.11.3}
Show that a continuous bijective map \( f: E^{1} \to E^{1} \) is an open map.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	The key result in this proof is that \( f \) is strictly monotonic.

	Suppose on the contrary that \( f \) is not strictly monotonic, then there exists \( a < b < c \) such that \( f(b) \) is not between \( f(a), f(c) \). Hence either \( f(b) < \min\left\{ f(a), f(c) \right\} \) or \( f(b) > \max\left\{ f(a), f(c) \right\} \).

	\textbf{Case 1.} \( f(b) < \min\left\{ f(a), f(c) \right\} \).

	\( f \) is continuous on \( \closedinterval{a, b} \) so by the intermediate value theorem, for any \( y \) between \( f(a) \) and \( f(b) \), there exists \( x_{1} \in \closedinterval{a, b} \) such that \( f(x_{1}) = y \).

	\( f \) is continuous on \( \closedinterval{b, c} \) so by the intermediate value theorem, for any \( y \) between \( f(b) \) and \( f(c) \), there exists \( x_{1} \in \closedinterval{a, b} \) such that \( f(x_{2}) = y \).

	Let \( y \) be a real number strictly between \( f(b) \) and \( \min\left\{ f(a), f(c) \right\} \) then there exists \( x_{1} \in \closedinterval{a, b} \) and \( x_{2} \in \closedinterval{b, c} \) such that \( f(x_{1}) = f(x_{2}) = y \).

	\( f \) is bijective so \( x_{1} = x_{2} = b \), which means \( f(b) = y \), which contradicts the definition of \( y \) (it is strictly between \( f(b) \) and \( \min\left\{ f(a), f(c) \right\} \)).

	\textbf{Case 2.} \( f(b) > \min\left\{ f(a), f(c) \right\} \).

	\( f \) is continuous on \( \closedinterval{a, b} \) so by the intermediate value theorem, for any \( y \) between \( f(a) \) and \( f(b) \), there exists \( x_{1} \in \closedinterval{a, b} \) such that \( f(x_{1}) = y \).

	\( f \) is continuous on \( \closedinterval{b, c} \) so by the intermediate value theorem, for any \( y \) between \( f(b) \) and \( f(c) \), there exists \( x_{1} \in \closedinterval{a, b} \) such that \( f(x_{2}) = y \).

	Let \( y \) be a real number strictly between \( f(b) \) and \( \max\left\{ f(a), f(c) \right\} \) then there exists \( x_{1} \in \closedinterval{a, b} \) and \( x_{2} \in \closedinterval{b, c} \) such that \( f(x_{1}) = f(x_{2}) = y \).

	\( f \) is bijective so \( x_{1} = x_{2} = b \), which means \( f(b) = y \), which contradicts the definition of \( y \) (it is strictly between \( f(b) \) and \( \min\left\{ f(a), f(c) \right\} \)).

	Hence \( f \) must be strictly monotonic.

	Let \( \openinterval{a, b} \) be an open interval then \( f(x) \) is strictly between \( f(a), f(b) \) for every \( x \in \openinterval{a, b} \). Conversely, if \( y \) is strictly between  \( f(a) \) and \( f(b) \) then \( f^{-1}(y) \) is strictly between \( a \) and \( b \). Hence the image of \( \openinterval{a, b} \) under \( f \) is an open interval, which is open in \( E^{1} \).

	Thus \( f \) is an open map, as the images of basic open sets in \( E^{1} \) under \( f \) are open.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.11.4}
Give an example to show that a continuous open map need not map the interior of a set onto the interior of the image.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	We define two topological spaces \( X, Y \) as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \( X = \left\{ 0, 1, 2 \right\}, \mathscr{T}_{X} = \left\{ \varnothing, X, \left\{ 0 \right\}, \left\{ 0, 1 \right\}, \left\{ 0, 2 \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( Y = \left\{ 0, 1 \right\}, \mathscr{T}_{Y} = \left\{ \varnothing, Y, \left\{ 0 \right\}, \left\{ 0, 1 \right\} \right\} \)
	\end{itemize}

	and the map \( f: X \to Y \) is given by \( f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 0 \) then \( f \) is a continuous open map.

	Let \( A = \left\{ 2 \right\} \) then \( f(\operatorname{Int}(A)) = f(\varnothing) = \varnothing \ne \left\{ 1 \right\} = \operatorname{Int}(f(A)) \). This example shows that a continuous open map need not map the interior of a set onto the interior of the image.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.11.5}
Let \(X\) be any space, and \(f: X \to E^{n}\) an open mapping. Denote the distance of \( f(x) \in E^{n} \) to the origin by \( \left\vert f(x) \right\vert \). Let \( A \subset X \) be any set. Prove that \( \left\vert f(a) \right\vert < \sup\limits_{x\in A}\left\{ \left\vert f(x) \right\vert \right\} \) for every \( a \in \operatorname{Int}(A) \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\( f \) is open so according to Theorem 11.3 (part 4), there is an open ball \( B(f(a), \varepsilon) \) such that \( B(f(a), \varepsilon) \subset f(\operatorname{Int}(A)) \subset f(A) \).

	If \( f(a) = 0 \) then \( \left\vert f(a) \right\vert < \varepsilon \le \sup\limits_{x\in A}\left\{ \left\vert f(x) \right\vert \right\} \).

	If \( f(a) \ne 0 \) then there is a straight line passing through the origin and \( f(a) \). This straight line intersects \( B(f(a), \varepsilon) \) at two points \( x, y \) and \( \left\vert f(a) \right\vert < \max\left\{ \left\vert x \right\vert, \left\vert y \right\vert \right\} \le \sup\limits_{x\in A}\left\{ \left\vert f(x) \right\vert \right\} \).

	Thus \( \left\vert f(a) \right\vert < \sup\limits_{x\in A}\left\{ \left\vert f(x) \right\vert \right\} \) for every \( a \in \operatorname{Int}(A) \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.11.6}
Show that \( f: X \to Y \) is open if and only if \( f^{-1}\left\lbrack \operatorname{Fr}(B) \right\rbrack \subset \operatorname{Fr}\left\lbrack f^{-1}(B) \right\rbrack \) for each \( B \subset Y \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\begingroup
	\allowdisplaybreaks%
	\begin{align*}
		f^{-1}\left\lbrack \operatorname{Fr}(B) \right\rbrack & = f^{-1}\left\lbrack \overline{B} \cap \overline{\mathscr{C}B} \right\rbrack = f^{-1}(\overline{B}) \cap f^{-1}(\overline{\mathscr{C}B}) \\
		\operatorname{Fr}\left\lbrack f^{-1}(B) \right\rbrack & = \overline{f^{-1}(B)} \cap \overline{\mathscr{C}f^{-1}(B)} = \overline{f^{-1}(B)} \cap \overline{f^{-1}(\mathscr{C}B)}
	\end{align*}
	\endgroup

	Suppose \( f \) is an open map.

	If \( x \in f^{-1}(\overline{B}) \) then \( f(x) \in \overline{B} \). Let \( U \) be a neighborhood of \( x \) then \( f(U) \) is a neighborhood of \( f(x) \) as \( f \) is an open map. Therefore \( f(U) \cap B \ne \varnothing \) so there is \( x_{0} \in U \) such that \( f(x_{0}) \in B \). Hence \( x_{0} \in U \cap f^{-1}(B) \), which means \( U \cap f^{-1}(B) \ne \varnothing \). Thus every neighborhood of \( x \) intersects \( f^{-1}(B) \), which implies \( x \in \overline{f^{-1}(B)} \). Hence \( f^{-1}(\overline{B}) \subset \overline{f^{-1}(B)} \). Similarly, \( f^{-1}(\overline{\mathscr{C}B}) \subset \overline{f^{-1}(\mathscr{C}B)} \), so \( f^{-1}\left\lbrack \operatorname{Fr}(B) \right\rbrack \subset \operatorname{Fr}\left\lbrack f^{-1}(B) \right\rbrack \).

	\bigskip

	Conversely, suppose that \( f^{-1}\left\lbrack \operatorname{Fr}(B) \right\rbrack \subset \operatorname{Fr}\left\lbrack f^{-1}(B) \right\rbrack \) for each \( B \subset Y \).

	Let \( U \) be an open set in \( X \). Assume that \( f(U) \cap \operatorname{Fr}(f(U)) \ne \varnothing \) then there is \( x\in U \) such that \( f(x) \in \operatorname{Fr}(f(U)) \). Hence \( x \in f^{-1}\left\lbrack \operatorname{Fr}(f(U)) \right\rbrack \subset \operatorname{Fr}\left\lbrack f^{-1}(f(U)) \right\rbrack \), so every neighborhood of \( x \) intersects \( f^{-1}(f(U)) \) and \( X - f^{-1}(f(U)) \). However, this is a contradiction for \( U \subset f^{-1}(f(U)) \). Hence \( f(U) \cap \operatorname{Fr}(f(U)) = \varnothing \), which means \( f(U) \) doesn't contain any of its boundary points, so \( f(U) \) is open.

	Thus \( f \) is an open map.

Let \( f: X \to Y \) and \( g: Y \to Z \). Prove:

	\item If \( g \circ f \) is open (closed) and \( f \) is continuous, surjective, then \( g \) is open (closed).
	\item If \( g \circ f \) is open (closed) and \( g \) is continuous, injective, then \( f \) is open (closed).
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
		\item If \( f, g \) are open (closed) and \( U \) is open (closed) in \( X \) then \( f(U) \) is open (closed) in \( Y \), and \( g(f(U)) \) is open (closed) in \( Z \). Hence \( g \circ f \) is open (closed).
		\item If \( U \) is open (closed) in \( Y \) then \( f^{-1}(U) \) is open (closed) in \( X \) because \( f \) is continuous. Moreover, \( f(f^{-1}(U)) = U \) as \( f \) is surjective. Therefore \( g(U) = g(f(f^{-1}(U))) = (g\circ f)(f^{-1}(U)) \) is open (closed) if \( g\circ f \) is open (closed).
		\item If \( U \) is open (closed) in \( X \) and \( g \circ f \) is open (closed) then \( g(f(U)) \) is open (closed). Since \( g \) is continuous and injective, \( g^{-1}(g(f(U))) = f(U) \) is open (closed). Hence \( f \) is open (closed).
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.11.8}\label{problem:III.11.8}
Let \( f: X \to Y \) be open (closed). Show that if \( A = f^{-1}(B) \) for some \( B \subset Y \), then \( f\vert_{A} \) is also an open (closed) map into \( B \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Let \( S \) be an open (closed) subset of \( A \) then there is an open (closed) subset \( U \) of \( X \) such that \( S = A \cap U \).
	\begingroup
	\allowdisplaybreaks%
	\begin{align*}

		              & = B \cap f(U)
	\end{align*}
	\endgroup

	Because \( f(U) \) is open (closed) in \( Y \) as \( U \) is open (closed) in \( X \) and \( f \) is open (closed), so \( B \cap f(U) \) is open (closed) in \( B \).

	Thus \( f\vert_{A} \) is an open (closed) map into \( B \).

\begin{problem}{III.11.9}
Let \(\{ B_{\alpha} \mid \alpha \in \mathscr{A} \}\) be an open, or nbd-finite closed, covering of \( Y \). Let \( f: X \to Y \) be such that for each \( \alpha \in \mathscr{A}, f\vert_{f^{-1}(B_{\alpha})} \) is an open (closed) map of \( f^{-1}(B_{\alpha}) \) into \( B_{\alpha} \). Show that \( f \) is an open (closed) map.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Let \( U \) be an open (closed) subset of \( X \) then \( U \cap B_{\alpha} \) is open (closed) in \( B_{\alpha} \).

	According to Problem~\ref{problem:III.11.8}, \( f\vert_{f^{-1}(B_{\alpha})} \) is an open (closed) map of \( f^{-1}(B_{\alpha}) \) into \( B_{\alpha} \).

	Because \( f(U) \cap B_{\alpha} = f(U \cap f^{-1}(B_{\alpha})) \), \( U \cap f^{-1}(B_{\alpha}) \) is open (closed) in \( B_{\alpha} \), and for each \( \alpha \in \mathscr{A} \), \( f\vert_{f^{-1}(B_{\alpha})} \) is an open (closed) map of \( f^{-1}(B_{\alpha}) \) into \( B_{\alpha} \), then \( f(U) \cap B_{\alpha} \) is open (closed) for each \( \alpha \in \mathscr{A} \).

	Therefore \( f(U) \) is open (closed). Thus \( f \) is an open (closed) map.

Prove: A \st{surjective} map \( p: X \to Y \) is a closed map if and only if it satisfies the condition of 11.2(1).
\end{problem}

\begin{quote}
	Repeat 11.2(1):

	Let \( p: X \to Y \) be a closed map. Given any subset \( S \subset Y \) and any open \( U \) containing \( p^{-1}(S) \), there exists an open \( V \supset S \) such that \( p^{-1}(V) \subset U \).
\end{quote}

\begin{proof}
	Suppose that \( p \) is closed.

	\( X - U \) is closed in \(X\) so \( p(X - U) \) is closed in \( Y \). Therefore \( Y - p(X - U) \) is open in \( Y \). Let \( V = Y - p(X - U) \) then

	\begin{align*}
		p^{-1}(V) = X - p^{-1}(p(X - U)) \subset U
	\end{align*}
	\endgroup

	as \( X - U \subset p^{-1}(p(X - U)) \). So \( V \) is an open set containing \( S \) such that \( p^{-1}(V) \subset U \).

	Conversely, suppose that for any \( S \subset Y \) and any open set \( U \supset p^{-1}(S) \), there exists an open \( V \supset S \) such that \( p^{-1}(V) \subset U \).

	Let \( A \) be a closed set in \( X \) then \( X - A \) is open in \( X \).
	\[
		p^{-1}(Y - p(A)) = p^{-1}(Y) - p^{-1}(p(A)) = X - p^{-1}(p(A)) \subset X - A.
	\]

	According to the hypothesis, there is an open set \( V \supset Y - p(A) \) such that \( p^{-1}(V) \subset X - A \).

	Suppose \( y \in V \). Because \( p^{-1}(\left\{ y \right\}) \subset p^{-1}(V) \subset X - A \), one has \( p^{-1}(\left\{ y \right\}) \cap A = \varnothing \).

	Assume for the sake of contradiction that \( y \in p(A) \) then there is \( x \in A \) such that \( p(x) = y \), which implies \( p^{-1}(\left\{ y \right\}) \cap A \ne \varnothing \). Hence \( y \notin p(A) \) for every \( y \in V \), which means \( V \subset Y - p(A) \).

	Therefore \( V = Y - p(A) \), which means \( p(A) \) is closed. Thus \( p \) is a closed map.

	\( p(S), p(A) \) are closed in \( Y \) and \( p(S) \subset p(A) \) so \( p\vert_{A}(S) = p(S) \) is closed in \( p(A) \). Hence \( p\vert_{A} \) is a closed mapping of \(A\) into \(p(A)\).

	\item \( p: X \to Y \) is a closed map.
	\item If \( U \subset X \) is open, then \(\{ y \mid p^{-1}(y) \subset U \}\) is open in \( Y \).
	\item If \( A \subset X \) is closed, then \(\{ y \mid p^{-1}(y) \cap A \neq \varnothing \}\) is closed in \( Y \).
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	(b) and (c) are equivalent as an open set is the complement of a closed set and vice versa. So it remains to show that (a) and (b) are equivalent.

	Denote \( \left\{ y \mid p^{-1}(y) \subset U \right\} \) by \( S_{U} \).

	Suppose that (a) holds. Let \( U \) be an open set in \( X \) and \( y \in S_{U} \). If \( p^{-1}(y) \subset U \) then according to Theorem 11.2(1) there is an open set \( V \) in \( Y \) such that \( y \in V \) and \( p^{-1}(V) \subset U \). Therefore \( V \subset S_{U} \) as for every \( z \in V \), one has \( p^{-1}(z) \subset p^{-1}(V) \subset U \). Hence every element of \( S_{U} \) has a neighborhood contained in \( S_{U}\), which means \( S_{U} \) is open in \( Y \).

	Conversely, suppose that (b) holds. Let \( A \) be a closed set in \( X \).
	\[
		p^{-1}(Y - p(A)) = p^{-1}(Y) - p^{-1}(p(A)) = X - p^{-1}(p(A)) \subset X - A.
	\]

	According to the hypothesis, \( V = \left\{ y \mid p^{-1}(y) \subset X - A \right\} \) is open in \( Y \). Moreover, \( Y - p(A) \subset V \).

	Let \( y \) be a point in \( V \), then \( p^{-1}(y) \subset p^{-1}(V) \subset X - A \) and \( p^{-1}(y) \cap A = \varnothing \). Suppose on the contrary that \( y \in p(A) \) then there is \( x \in A \) such that \( p(x) = y \), which implies \( p^{-1}(y) \cap A \ne \varnothing \), a contradiction. Hence \( y \notin p(A) \) for every \( y \in V \), which implies \( V \subset Y - p(A) \).

	\( Y - p(A) \subset V \) and \( V \subset Y - p(A) \) means \( Y - p(A) = V \). Since \( V \) is open in \( Y \), we conclude that \( p(A) \) is closed in \( Y \). Thus \( p \) is a closed map.

Let \( c: I \to 2 \) be the characteristic function of \(\closedinterval{0, \frac{1}{2}} \subset I \). Show that \( c \) is surjective, open, closed, but not continuous.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\( c \) is surjective, as \( c^{-1}(0) = \halfopenleft{\frac{1}{2}, 1} \) and \( c^{-1}(1) = \closedinterval{0, \frac{1}{2}} \).

	Since \(2\) is a discrete space, \( c(A) \) is open and closed in \( 2 \) for any subset \( A \subset I \), which means \( c \) is open and closed.

	\( \left\{ 1 \right\} \) is open in \( 2 \) but \( c^{-1}(1) = \closedinterval{0, \frac{1}{2}} \) is not open in \( I \). Hence \(c\) is not continuous.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.11.16}
Let \( p: X \to Y \) be an open and closed map. Let \( \varphi: X \to I \) be continuous, and for each \( y \in Y \), let \( \hat{\varphi}(y) = \sup \left\lbrack\varphi\vert_{p^{-1}(y)} \right\rbrack \). Prove: \( \hat{\varphi}: Y \to I \) is continuous.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	We will show that \( \hat{\varphi} \) is lower semicontinuous and upper semicontinuous.

	\textbf{\( \hat{\varphi} \) is lower semicontinuous.}

	Let \( U_{a} = \hat{\varphi}^{-1}(\halfopenleft{a, 1}) = \left\{ y \in Y \mid a < \hat{\varphi}(y) \le 1 \right\} \) and \( B_{a} = \left\{ x \in X \mid a < \varphi(x) \le 1 \right\} \). The set \( B_{a} \) is open in \( X \) as \( \varphi \) is continuous.

	If \( y \in p(B_{a}) \) then there exists \( x \in B_{a} \) such that \( p(x) = y \). According to the definition of \( B_{a} \), \( \varphi(x) > a \), so \( \hat{\varphi}(y) = \sup \left\lbrack \varphi\vert_{p^{-1}(y)} \right\rbrack > a \), which means \( y \in U_{a} \). Therefore \( p(B_{a}) \subset U_{a} \).

	Conversely, if \( y \in U_{a} \) then \( \sup \left\lbrack \varphi\vert_{p^{-1}(y)} \right\rbrack > a \), which means \( p^{-1}(y) \ne \varnothing \) (otherwise, \( \sup \left\lbrack \varphi\vert_{p^{-1}(y)} \right\rbrack = 0 > a \)). So there is \( x \in p^{-1}(y) \) such that \( \varphi(x) > a \) (proved by contradiction), hence \( x \in B_{a} \) and \( y = p(x) \in p(B_{a}) \).

	Therefore \( U_{a} = p(B_{a}) \). Moreover \( p \) is an open map, so \( p(B_{a}) \) is open, and \( U_{a} \) is open. Thus \( \hat{\varphi} \) is lower semicontinuous.

	\textbf{\( \hat{\varphi} \) is upper semicontinuous.}

	Let \( V_{a} = \hat{\varphi}^{-1}(\halfopenright{0, a}) = \left\{ y \in Y \mid 0 \le \hat{\varphi}(y) < a \right\} \).

	Suppose \( y \in V_{a} \) then \( \hat{\varphi}(y) < a \). Let \( b \) be a real number between \( \hat{\varphi}(y) \) and \( a \), so \( \varphi(x) < b \) whenever \( x \in p^{-1}(y) \).

	Let \( W = \left\{ x \in X \mid \varphi(x) < b \right\} \). The set \( W \) is open in \( X \) as \( \varphi \) is continuous.

	(This is where we use the closedness of \( p \)) According to Problem~\ref{problem:III.11.10}, because \( p^{-1}(y) \) is contained in the open set \( W \), there is an open set \( V \) in \( Y \) such that \( y \in V \) and \( p^{-1}(V) \subset W \).

	If \( z \in V \) then \( p^{-1}(z) \subset p^{-1}(V) \subset W \), so \( \varphi(x) < b \) whenever \( x \in p^{-1}(z) \). Hence \( \hat{\varphi}(z) \le b < a \), so \( z \in V_{a} \).

	Therefore, for every \( y \in V_{a} \), there exists an open set \( V \) containing \( y \) such that \( V \subset V_{a} \). Thus \( V_{a} \) is open in \( Y \) and \( \hat{\varphi} \) is upper semicontinuous.

	\bigskip
	Hence \( \hat{\varphi} \) is continuous.

\section{Homeomorphism}

\begin{problem}{III.12.1}
In \( E^{2} \), let \( V^{2} = \overline{B(0, 1)} \). Show \( V^{2} \cong I \times I \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Firstly, we will prove that \( V^{2} \cong \closedinterval{-1, 1} \times \closedinterval{-1, 1} \).

	The map \( \operatorname{abs}: E^{1} \to E^{1} \) given by \( \operatorname{abs}(x) = \left\vert x \right\vert \) is continuous.

	The map \( f: E^{2} \to E^{1} \) given by \( f(x, y) = \max\left\{ x, y \right\} \) is continuous because
	\[
		f(x, y) = \dfrac{x + y + \left\vert x - y \right\vert}{2}.
	\]

	The map \( b: \operatorname{Fr}(B(0, 1)) \to \operatorname{Fr}(\closedinterval{-1, 1} \times \closedinterval{-1, 1}) \) given by
	\[
		b(x, y) = \left( \dfrac{x}{\max\left\{ \left\vert x \right\vert, \left\vert y \right\vert \right\}}, \dfrac{y}{\max\left\{ \left\vert x \right\vert, \left\vert y \right\vert \right\}} \right)
	\]

	is continuous.

	The map \( c: \operatorname{Fr}(\closedinterval{-1, 1} \times \closedinterval{-1, 1}) \to \operatorname{Fr}(B(0, 1)) \) given by
	\[
		c(x, y) = \left( \dfrac{x}{\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}}, \dfrac{y}{\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}} \right)
	\]

	is continuous.

	Moreover, \( c \) is the inverse of \( b \) so \( b, c \) are homeomorphisms.

	We define the map \( f: \overline{B(0, 1)} \to \closedinterval{-1, 1} \times \closedinterval{-1, 1} \) as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \( f(0, 0) = (0, 0) \)
		\item If \( (x, y) \ne (0, 0) \) then there exists a unique positive number \( t = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}} \) such that \( (tx, ty) \in \operatorname{Fr}(B(0, 1)) \), define \( f(x, y) = \dfrac{1}{t} b(tx, ty) \)
	\end{itemize}

	and define the map \( g: \closedinterval{-1, 1} \times \closedinterval{-1, 1} \to \overline{B(0, 1)} \) as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \( g(0, 0) = (0, 0) \)
		\item If \( (x, y) \ne (0, 0) \) then there exists a unique positive number \( t = \dfrac{1}{\max\left\{ \left\vert x\right\vert, \left\vert y\right\vert \right\}} \) such that \( (tx, ty) \in \operatorname{Fr}(\closedinterval{-1, 1} \times \closedinterval{-1, 1}) \), define \( g(x, y) = \dfrac{1}{t}c(tx, ty) \)
	\end{itemize}

	Two maps \( f, g \) are inverses of each other and continuous on \( \overline{B(0, 1)} - \left\{ (0, 0) \right\} \) and \( \closedinterval{-1, 1} \times \closedinterval{-1, 1} - \left\{ (0, 0) \right\} \)
	\begingroup
	\allowdisplaybreaks%
	\begin{align*}
		\left\vert f(x, y) - f(0, 0) \right\vert & = \left\vert \dfrac{b(tx, ty)}{t} \right\vert < \sqrt{2(x^{2} + y^{2})}                                                                          \\
		\left\vert g(x, y) - g(0, 0) \right\vert & = \left\vert \dfrac{c(tx, ty)}{t} \right\vert = \max\left\{ \left\vert x \right\vert, \left\vert y \right\vert \right\} \le \sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}
	\end{align*}
	\endgroup

	so \( f, g \) are also continuous at the origin due to the \( \varepsilon - \delta \) definition of continuity. Hence \( f, g \) are continuous.

	Thus \( f, g \) are homeomorphisms and \( V^{2} \cong \closedinterval{-1, 1} \times \closedinterval{-1, 1} \).

	On the other hand, \( \closedinterval{-1, 1} \times \closedinterval{-1, 1} \cong I \times I \) because of the homeomorphism \( h: \closedinterval{-1, 1} \times \closedinterval{-1, 1} \cong I \times I \) defined by \( h(x, y) = \left( \dfrac{x + 1}{2}, \dfrac{y + 1}{2} \right) \).

	Hence \( V^{2} \cong I \times I \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.12.2}
Show that the space of \( n \times n \) matrices in Problem~\ref{problem:III.3.4} is homeomorphic to \( E^{n^{2}} \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Reuse the notation \( X \), which denotes the space of \( n \times n \) matrices in Problem~\ref{problem:III.3.4}.

	Let \( U_{r}(a) \) be a basic open set in \( X \). For each \( b \in U_{r}(a) \), \( B(b, r^{\prime}) \subset U_{r}(a) \), in which
	\[
		0 < r^{\prime} < \min\limits_{i,j}\left\{ r - \left\vert a_{ij} - b_{ij} \right\vert \right\}
	\]

	so \( U_{r}(a) \) is open in \( E^{n^{2}} \).

	Let \( B(a, \varepsilon) \) be a basic open set in \( E^{n^{2}} \). For each \( b \in B(a, \varepsilon) \), \( U_{r}(b) \subset B(a, \varepsilon) \), in which
	\[
		r = \varepsilon - \dfrac{\left\vert b - a \right\vert}{n}
	\]

	so \( B(a, \varepsilon) \) is open in \( X \).

	Hence the topology on \(X\) is the same as the Euclidean topology, which means \( X \) and \( E^{n^{2}} \) are homeomorphic.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.12.3}
Show:
\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
	\item \( (X \times Y) \times Z \cong X \times (Y \times Z) \),
	\item \( X \times Y \cong Y \times X \).
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
		\item Let \( 1: (X \times Y) \times Z \to X \times (Y \times Z) \) be the identity map. Evidently, \( 1 \) is bijective.

		      A basic open set in \( (X \times Y) \times Z \) is of the form \( (U_{X} \times U_{Y}) \times U_{Z} \) in which \( U_{X}, U_{Y}, U_{Z} \) are open in \( X, Y, Z \), respectively. The image of \( (U_{X} \times U_{Y}) \times U_{Z} \) under \( 1 \) is \( U_{X} \times (U_{Y} \times U_{Z}) \), which is open in \( X \times (Y \times Z) \), therefore \( 1 \) is open.

		      Similarly, \( 1^{-1} \) is open. Thus \( 1: (X \times Y) \times Z \cong X \times (Y \times Z) \).
		\item Define \( f: X \times Y \to Y \times X \) by \( f(x, y) = (y, x) \) and \( g: Y \times X \to X \times Y \) by \( g(x, y) = (y, x) \) then \( f, g \) are inverses of each other.

		      A basic open set in \( X \times Y \) is of the form \( U_{X} \times U_{Y} \). The image of \( U_{X} \times U_{Y} \) under \( f \) is \( U_{Y} \times U_{X} \), which is open in \( Y \times X \).

		      Similarly, \( g \) is open. Thus \( f, g \) are homeomorphisms and \( X \times Y \cong Y \times X \).
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.12.4}
Let \( f: X \to Y \) be a map, and \( G(f) \subset X \times Y \) the subspace \( \left\{ (x, f(x)) \mid x \in X \right\} \). Show that \( x \mapsto (x, f(x)) \) is a homeomorphism if and only if \(f\) is continuous.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	The maps \( p_{1}: X \times Y \to X \) and \( p_{2}: X \times Y \to Y \) given by \( p_{1}(x, y) = x \) and \( p_{2}(x, y) = y \) are continuous. The map \( \iota: G(f) \to X \times Y \) is continuous.

	Suppose \( g: x \mapsto (x, f(x)) \) is a homeomorphism then \( f \) is continuous, as \( f = p_{2} \circ g \), a composition of two continuous functions.

	\bigskip

	Conversely, suppose that \( f \) is continuous. The map \( \iota\circ g: X \to X \times Y \) is continuous because \( p_{1} \circ \iota \circ g = \operatorname{id}_{X} \) and \( p_{2} \circ \iota \circ g = f \) are continuous.

	If \( V \) is open in \( G(f) \) then there is an open set \( U \) in \( X\times Y \) such that \( V = G(f) \cap U \). Moreover
	\[
		g^{-1}(V) = g^{-1}(\iota^{-1}(U)) = {(\iota \circ g)}^{-1}(U)
	\]

	is open in \( X \) because \( \iota \circ g \) is continuous, so \( g \) is continuous.

	\( g^{-1}: G(f) \to X \) is the same as \( p_{1}\vert_{G(f)}: G(f) \to X \) (this is a continuous map) so \( g^{-1} \) is continuous.

	Moreover, \(g\) is bijective so \( g \) is a homeomorphism.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.12.5}
Let \( A, B \) be countable dense subsets of \( E^{1} \). Show \( A \cong B \). [There is even a homeomorphism of \( E^{1} \) carrying \(A\) onto \(B\)].
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	According to Cantor's isomorphism theorem, \( A \) and \( B \) are order-isomorphic. The subspace topologies on \( A, B \) are order topologies induced by the Euclidean topology. Hence \( A \cong B \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.12.6}
Let \( f: X \to Y \) and \( g: Y \to X \) be embeddings. Show that \( X \) and \( Y \) can be written as disjoint unions: \( X = X_{1} \cup X_{2}, Y = Y_{1} \cup Y_{2} \) such that \( f\vert_{X_{1}}: X_{1} \cong Y_{1} \) and \( g\vert_{Y_{2}}: Y_{2} \cong X_{2} \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	According to Problem~\ref{problem:I.6.7}, \( X \) and \( Y \) can be written as disjoint unions: \( X = X_{1} \cup X_{2}, Y = Y_{1} \cup Y_{2} \) such that \( f(X_{1}) = Y_{1} \) and \( g(Y_{2}) = X_{2} \). Since \( f, g \) are embeddings, it follows that \( f\vert_{X_{1}}: X_{1} \cong Y_{1} \) and \( g\vert_{Y_{2}}: Y_{2} \cong X_{2} \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.12.7}
Let \( \left\{ B_{\alpha} \mid \alpha \in \mathscr{A} \right\} \) be an open, or nbd-finite closed, covering of \( Y \). Let \( f: X \to Y \) be continuous, and assume that for each \( \alpha \in \mathscr{A} \), \( f\vert_{f^{-1}(B_{\alpha})} \) is a homeomorphism of \( f^{-1}(B_{\alpha}) \) and \( B_{\alpha} \). Prove that \( f: X \cong Y \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Let \( U \) be an open (closed) set in \( X \) then \( U \cap f^{-1}(B_{\alpha}) \) is open (closed) in \( f^{-1}(B_{\alpha}) \). Therefore
	\[
		f\vert_{f^{-1}(B_{\alpha})}(U \cap f^{-1}(B_{\alpha})) = f(U \cap f^{-1}(B_{\alpha})) = f(U) \cap B_{\alpha}
	\]

	is open (closed) in \( B_{\alpha} \) as \( f\vert_{f^{-1}(B_{\alpha})} \) is a homeomorphism of \( f^{-1}(B_{\alpha}) \) and \( B_{\alpha} \). Since \( \left\{ B_{\alpha} \mid \alpha \in \mathscr{A} \right\} \) is an open, or nbd-finite closed, covering of \( Y \), we deduce that \( f(U) \) is open (closed).

	Hence \( f \) is an open and closed map.

	Let \( y \in Y \) then there is \( \alpha\in\mathscr{A} \) such that \( y \in B_{\alpha} \). Since \( f\vert_{f^{-1}(B_{\alpha})}: f^{-1}(B_{\alpha}) \to B_{\alpha} \) is a homeomorphism, it follows that there is \( x \in f^{-1}(B_{\alpha}) \) such that \( f(x) = y \). Therefore \( f \) is surjective.

	Suppose that \( y = f(x_{1}) = f(x_{2}) \) then there are \( \alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2} \in \mathscr{A} \) such that \( x_{1} \in f^{-1}(B_{\alpha_{1}}), x_{2} \in f^{-1}(B_{\alpha_{2}}) \). This means \( y = f(x_{1}) \in B_{\alpha_{1}}, y = f(x_{2}) \in B_{\alpha_{2}} \) and
	\[
		f^{-1}(y) = f^{-1}(B_{\alpha_{1}} \cap B_{\alpha_{2}}) = f^{-1}(B_{\alpha_{1}}) \cap f^{-1}(B_{\alpha_{2}})
	\]

	which means \( x_{1}, x_{2} \in f^{-1}(B_{\alpha_{1}}) \cap f^{-1}(B_{\alpha_{2}}) \). Because the map \( f\vert_{f^{-1}(B_{\alpha})}: f^{-1}(B_{\alpha}) \to B_{\alpha} \) is bijective then
	\[
		f\vert_{f^{-1}(B_{\alpha_{1}}) \cap f^{-1}(B_{\alpha_{2}})}: f^{-1}(B_{\alpha_{1}}) \cap f^{-1}(B_{\alpha_{2}}) \to B_{\alpha_{1}}
	\]

	is injective, it follows that \( x_{1} = x_{2} \). Hence \( f \) is injective.

	Thus \( f \) is bijective, continuous, and open, so \( f: X \cong Y \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.12.8}
Show that the map \( x \mapsto e^{\iota x} \) of \( \halfopenright{0, 2\pi} \) onto \( S^{1} \) is not a homeomorphism.
\end{problem}

\begin{quote}
	Note that the given map is a continuous bijection.
\end{quote}

\begin{proof}
	Denote the map by \( f \). The set \( \halfopenright{0, \pi} \) is open in \( \halfopenright{0, 2\pi} \). However, \( f(\halfopenright{0, \pi}) \) is not open as there is no neighborhood of \( 1 \in S^{1} \) contained in \( f(\halfopenright{0, \pi}) \). Hence \( f \) is not a homeomorphism.
\end{proof}

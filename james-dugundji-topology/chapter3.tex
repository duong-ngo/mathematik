\begin{problem}{III.1.1}
\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)},leftmargin=*]
	\item Let \( X \) be an infinite set. Show that \( \mathscr{A}_{0} = \left\{ \varnothing \right\} \cup \left\{ A \mid \mathscr{C}A \text{ is finite} \right\} \) is a topology.
	\item Let \( \aleph(X) \ge \aleph_{0} \). Show that \( \mathscr{A}_{1} = \left\{ \varnothing \right\} \cup \left\{ A \mid \aleph(\mathscr{C}A) < \aleph(X) \right\} \) is a topology.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\( \mathscr{A}_{0} \) is called the cofinite topology on \( X \).

\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)},leftmargin=*]
		\item \( \varnothing \in \mathscr{A}_{0} \) and \( \mathscr{C}X = \varnothing \) is finite so \( \mathscr{A}_{0} \) contains \( \varnothing \) and \( X \).

		      Assume that \( {(A_{\alpha})}_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \) is a family of elements of \( \mathscr{A}_{0} \). According to the De Morgan's laws
		      \begin{align*}
			      \mathscr{C}\left( \bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} A_{\alpha} \right) = \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha}
		      \end{align*}

		      If there exists \( \alpha \in \mathscr{A} \) such that \( \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha} \) is finite, then \( \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha} \) is finite for being a subset of \( \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha} \). Otherwise, \( \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha} = \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} X = X \). In either case, it is true that \( \bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} A_{\alpha} \in \mathscr{A}_{0} \).

		      Moreover, if \( \mathscr{A} \) is finite then
		      \begin{align*}
			      \mathscr{C}\left( \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} A_{\alpha} \right) = \bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha}
		      \end{align*}

		      If there exists \( \alpha \in \mathscr{A} \) such that \( A_{\alpha} = \varnothing \) then \( \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} A_{\alpha} = \varnothing \in \mathscr{A}_{0} \). Otherwise, \( \mathscr{A} \) is finite and each \( \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha} \) is finite, so their union is also finite, which implies that \( \bigcup_{\alpha\in}\mathscr{C}A_{\alpha} \) is finite. In either case, it is true that \( \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} A_{\alpha} \in \mathscr{A}_{0} \) for any finite \( \mathscr{A} \).

		      Thus \( \mathscr{A}_{0} \) is a topology.
		\item \( \varnothing \in \mathscr{A}_{1} \) and \( \mathscr{C}X = \varnothing \) so \( \mathscr{A}_{1} \) contains \( \varnothing \) and \( X \).

		      Assume that \( {(A_{\alpha})}_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \) is a family of elements of \( \mathscr{A}_{1} \). According to the De Morgan's laws
		      \begin{align*}
			      \mathscr{C}\left( \bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} A_{\alpha} \right) = \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha}
		      \end{align*}

		      If there exists \( \alpha \in \mathscr{A} \) such that \( \aleph(\mathscr{C}A_{\alpha}) < \aleph(X) \), then \( \aleph\left(\bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha}\right) \le \aleph(\mathscr{C}A_{\alpha}) < \aleph(X) \). Otherwise, \( \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha} = \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} X = X \). In either case, it is true that \( \bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} A_{\alpha} \in \mathscr{A}_{1} \).

		      Moreover, if \( \mathscr{A} \) is finite then
		      \begin{align*}
			      \mathscr{C}\left( \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} A_{\alpha} \right) = \bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha}
		      \end{align*}

		      If there exists \( \alpha \in \mathscr{A} \) such that \( A_{\alpha} = \varnothing \) then \( \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} A_{\alpha} = \varnothing \in \mathscr{A}_{1} \). Otherwise, \( \mathscr{A} \) is finite and \( \aleph(\mathscr{C}A_{\alpha}) < \aleph(X) \) for each \( \alpha \).

		      We show that if \( X \) is infinite, \( A, B \subset X \) and \( \aleph(A) < \aleph(X), \aleph(B) < \aleph(X) \) then \( \aleph(A \cup B) < \aleph(X) \). If \( A, B \) are both finite then \( \aleph(A \cup B) < \aleph_{0} < \aleph(X) \). Otherwise, \( \aleph(A \cup B) = \max\left\{\aleph(A); \aleph(B)\right\} < \aleph(X) \).

		      Using mathematical induction, one can show that \( \aleph\left( \bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \mathscr{C}A_{\alpha}\right) < \aleph(X) \).

		      In either case, it is true that \( \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} A_{\alpha} \in \mathscr{A}_{1} \) for any finite \( \mathscr{A} \).

		      Thus \( \mathscr{A}_{1} \) is a topology.

\begin{problem}{III.1.2}
How many distinct topologies can a set of three elements have? What is their partial ordering?
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	There are exactly 29 possible topologies on \( X = \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \).
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ b \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a, b \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ b, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a \right\}, \left\{ a, b \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ b \right\}, \left\{ a, b \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ c \right\}, \left\{ a, b \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a \right\}, \left\{ b \right\} \left\{ a, b \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a \right\}, \left\{ b, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ b \right\}, \left\{ b, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ c \right\}, \left\{ b, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ b \right\}, \left\{ c \right\} \left\{ b, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a \right\}, \left\{ a, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ b \right\}, \left\{ a, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ c \right\}, \left\{ a, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a \right\}, \left\{ c \right\}, \left\{ a, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ b \right\}, \left\{ a, b \right\}, \left\{ b, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a \right\}, \left\{ b \right\}, \left\{ a, b \right\}, \left\{ b, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ b \right\}, \left\{ c \right\}, \left\{ a, b \right\}, \left\{ b, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ c \right\}, \left\{ b, c \right\}, \left\{ a, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a \right\}, \left\{ c \right\}, \left\{ b, c \right\}, \left\{ a, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ b \right\}, \left\{ c \right\}, \left\{ b, c \right\}, \left\{ a, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a \right\}, \left\{ a, b \right\}, \left\{ a, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a \right\}, \left\{ b \right\}, \left\{ a, b \right\}, \left\{ a, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a \right\}, \left\{ c \right\}, \left\{ a, b \right\}, \left\{ a, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
		\item \( \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ a \right\}, \left\{ b \right\}, \left\{ c \right\}, \left\{ a, b \right\}, \left\{ b, c \right\}, \left\{ a, c \right\}, \left\{ a, b, c \right\} \right\} \)
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.1.3}
Let \( \mathscr{T}_{X}, \mathscr{T}_{Y} \) be topologies in \( X, Y \), respectively. Is
\[ \mathscr{T} = \left\{ A\times B \mid A \in \mathscr{T}_{X}, B \in \mathscr{T}_{Y} \right\} \]

a topology in \( X\times Y \)?
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	In general, it is not a topology in \( X\times Y \). Here is a counterexample.

	\( X = Y = \left\{ 0, 1 \right\} \) and \( \mathscr{T}_{X} = \mathscr{T}_{Y} = \left\{ \varnothing, \left\{ 0 \right\}, \left\{ 1 \right\}, \left\{ 0, 1 \right\} \right\} \). Let \( A_{1} = B_{1} = \left\{ 0 \right\} \) and \( A_{2} = B_{2} = \left\{ 1 \right\} \) then \( A_{1} \times B_{1}, A_{2} \times B_{2} \in \mathscr{T} \) and \( A_{1} \times B_{1} \cup A_{2} \times B_{2} = \left\{ (0, 0), (1, 1) \right\} \), which is not a Cartesian product of any two sets as it contains \( (0, 0), (1, 1) \) but not \( (0, 1), (1, 0) \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.1.4}\label{problem:III.1.4}
Let \( X \) be a partially ordered set. Define \( U \subset X \) to be open if it satisfies the condition: \( (x \in U) \land (y \prec x) \implies y \in U \). Show that \( \left\{ U \mid U \text{ is open} \right\} \) is a topology.
\end{problem}

This is in fact an Alexandrov topology, in which the intersection of arbitrarily many open sets is open.

\begin{proof}
	Let \( \mathscr{T} = \left\{ U \mid U \text{ is open} \right\} \) then \( \varnothing, X \in \mathscr{T} \) (the first one is vacuously true).

	Assume that \( {(U_{\alpha})}_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \) is a family of open sets and denote \( U = \bigcup_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} U_{\alpha}, V = \bigcap_{\alpha\in\mathscr{A}} \).

	If \( x \in U \) and \( y \prec x \) then there exists \( \alpha \in \mathscr{A} \) such that \( x \in U_{\alpha} \). From the definition of open sets, we deduce that \( y \in U_{\alpha} \subset U \). Therefore \( U \) is open.

	If \( x \in V \) and \( y \prec x \) then from the definition of open sets, we deduce that \( y \in U_{\alpha} \subset U \) for every \( \alpha\in\mathscr{A} \). Therefore \( V \) is open.

	Thus \( \left\{ U \mid U \text{ is open} \right\} \) is a topology.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.1.5}
In \( \mathbb{Z}^{+} \), define \( U \subset \mathbb{Z}^{+} \) to be open if it satisfies the condition: \( n \in U \implies \) every divisor of \( n \) belongs to \( U \). Show that this is a topology in \( \mathbb{Z}^{+} \) and that it is not the discrete topology.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	This is a particular case of the result in Problem~\ref{problem:III.1.4} as ``is a divisor of'' is a partial ordering on \( \mathbb{Z}^{+} \).

	This is not the discrete topology as it doesn't contain the subset of the form \( \left\{ n \right\} \) where \( n > 1 \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.1.6}
Prove: \( \mathscr{T} \) is the discrete topology in \( X \) if and only if every point is an open set.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	If \( \mathscr{T} \) is the discrete topology in \( X \) then every point is an open set by the definition of discrete topology.

	Conversely, if every point is an open set then every subset \( A \) of \( X \) is a union of open set, since \( A = \bigcup_{x\in A} \left\{x\right\} \), so \( A \in \mathscr{T} \) for every subset \( A \) of \( X \). Therefore \( \mathscr{T} \) is the discrete topology in \( X \).
\end{proof}

\section{Basis for a given topology}

\section{Topologizing of sets}

\begin{problem}{III.3.1}
Use 3.2 to verify the final statement of section 1, examples 4 and 5.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	The family of open intervals in \( E^{1} \) is a basis for the Euclidean topology in \( E^{1} \).

	The family of open balls in \( E^{n} \) is a basis for the Euclidean topology in \( E^{n} \).

	We prove the latter as it is more general. Let \( \mathscr{B} \) be the collection of open balls in \( E^{n} \) and \( B(x_{1}; r_{1}), B(x_{2}; r_{2}) \in \mathscr{B} \). If \( x \in B_{1}(x_{1}; r_{1}) \cap B_{2}(x_{2}; r_{2}) \), then \( x \in B(x; r) \subset B_{1}(x_{1}; r_{1}) \cap B_{2}(x_{2}; r_{2}) \), in which \( r = \min\left\{ r_{1} - \left\vert x - x_{1} \right\vert, r_{2} - \left\vert x - x_{2} \right\vert \right\} \). Hence \( \mathscr{B} \) is a basis for some topology in \( E^{n} \). Denote this topology by \( \mathscr{T}(\mathscr{B}) \).

	According to Theorem 3.2, \( \mathscr{T}(\mathscr{B}) \) is unique and is the smallest topology containing \( \mathscr{B} \). Hence the Euclidean topology \( \mathscr{T} \) in \( E^{n} \) contains \( \mathscr{T}(\mathscr{B}) \). Moreover, if \( G \in \mathscr{T} \) then for each \( x \in G \), there exists \( r(x) > 0 \) such that \( x \in B(x; r(x)) \subset G \), from which we deduce that \( G = \bigcup_{x\in G} B(x; r(x)) \in \mathscr{T}(\mathscr{B}) \). Hence \( \mathscr{T} = \mathscr{T}(\mathscr{B}) \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.3.2}
If, in the plane, all straight lines are taken as subbasis, what is the topology?
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Since all straight lines are taken as subbasis, then the intersections of non-parallel straight lines are open, which means any point is open. Therefore the topology is the discrete topology.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.3.3}
Describe the open sets if all straight lines in the plane parallel to the \(x\)-axis are used for subbasis.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Each open set is a union of straight lines parallel to the \(x\)-axis.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.3.4}
Let \(X\) be the set of all \( (n\times n) \) matrices of real numbers. For each \( a = {(a_{ij})} \) and \( r > 0 \), let \( U_{r}(a) = \left\{ (b_{ij}) \mid \forall i, j: \left\vert a_{ij} - b_{ij} \right\vert < r \right\} \). Show that these sets are the basis for a topology in \( X \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Assume that \( a \in U_{r_{1}}(a^{1}) \cap U_{r_{2}}(a^{2}) \) then \( a \in U_{r}(a) \subset U_{r_{1}}(a^{1}) \cap U_{r_{2}}(a^{2}) \) in which
	\[
		r = \min\limits_{i, j}\left\{ r_{1} - \left\vert a_{ij} - a^{1}_{ij} \right\vert, r_{2} - \left\vert a_{ij} - a^{2}_{ij} \right\vert \right\}
	\]

	so these sets are the basis for a topology in \(X\), according to Theorem 3.2.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.3.5}
Let \(C\) be the set of all continuous real-valued functions on \( [0, 1] \). For each \( f\in C \), each finite set \( x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n} \in [0, 1] \), and \( \varepsilon > 0 \), let \( U_{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, \varepsilon)}(f) = \left\{ g \mid \left\vert g(x_{i}) - f(x_{i}) \right\vert < \varepsilon, i = 1, \ldots, n \right\} \). Show (a) that these neighborhoods form a basis for some topology \( \mathscr{L} \); (b) that \( \mathscr{L} \subsetneq \mathscr{U} \); and (c) that \( \mathscr{L} \) and \( \mathscr{M} \) are not related in the partial ordering of topologies in \( C \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
		\item Assume that \( h \in U_{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, \varepsilon)}(f) \cap U_{(y_{1}, \ldots, y_{m}, \delta)}(g) \). We define
		      \begin{multline*}
			      r = \min\Bigl\{ \varepsilon - \left\vert h(x_{1}) - f(x_{1}) \right\vert, \ldots, \varepsilon - \left\vert h(x_{n}) - f(x_{n}) \right\vert, \\
			      \delta - \left\vert h(y_{1}) - g(y_{1}) \right\vert, \ldots, \delta - \left\vert h(y_{m}) - g(y_{m}) \right\vert \Bigr\}
		      \end{multline*}

		      then \( h \in U_{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, y_{1}, \ldots, y_{m}, r)}(h) \subset U_{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, \varepsilon)}(f) \cap U_{(y_{1}, \ldots, y_{m}, \delta)}(g) \).

		      Hence the given neighborhoods form a basis for some topology \( \mathscr{L} \).
		\item Let \( U_{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, \varepsilon)}(f) \) be a basic open set of \( \mathscr{L} \) and \( g \in U_{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, \varepsilon)}(f) \) then let
		      \[
			      \delta = \min\limits_{i}\left\{ \varepsilon - \left\vert f(x_{i}) - g(x_{i}) \right\vert \right\}
		      \]

		      then \( g \in U(g, \delta) \subset U_{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, \varepsilon)}(f) \). Hence \( \mathscr{L} \subset \mathscr{U} \).

		      Choose \( f \equiv 0 \) and consider \( U(f, 1) \). Let \( g \) be an element of \( U(f, 1) \) then \( \sup\limits_{x}\left\vert f(x) - g(x) \right\vert < 1 \). Consider \( x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n} \in [0, 1] \) and \( \varepsilon > 0 \). There exists a continuous function \( h \in U_{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, \varepsilon)}(g) \) such that \( h(x_{i}) = g(x_{i}) \) for \( i = 1, \ldots, n \) and \( h(x) = 1 \) for some \( x \in [0, 1] \) other than \( x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n} \) (for example, a piecewise linear function). Hence \( h \in U_{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, \varepsilon)}(f) \) but \( h \notin U(f, 1) \), which means \( U_{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, \varepsilon)}(g) \not\subset U(f, 1) \) for every \( g \in U(f, 1) \), every finite subset \( \left\{ x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n} \right\} \subset [0, 1] \), every \( \varepsilon > 0 \). This implies that \( U(f, 1) \) doesn't contains any basic open set of \( \mathscr{L} \), which means \( \mathscr{U} \ne \mathscr{L} \).

		      Thus \( \mathscr{L} \) is strictly coarser (smaller) than \( \mathscr{U} \).
		\item Choose \( f \equiv 0 \).

		      Let \( g \in M(f, 1) \) and \( \left\{ x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n} \right\} \subset [0, 1], \varepsilon > 0 \). Without loss of generality, when \( n > 1 \), one can assume \( 0 \le x_{1} < x_{2} < \cdots < x_{n} \le 1 \). There exists a continuous function \( h \in C \) such that \( h(x_{i}) = g(x_{i}) \) for \( i = 1, \ldots, n \) and \( \int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}}\left\vert h \right\vert = \int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}}\left\vert h - f \right\vert = 1 \). When \( n = 1 \), we can choose \( h \in C \) such that \( h(x_{1}) = g(x_{1}) \) and \( \int_{x_{1}}^{1}\left\vert h \right\vert = 1 \) (if \( x_{1} \ne 1 \)) or \( \int_{0}^{x_{1}}\left\vert h \right\vert = 1 \) (if \( x_{1} = 1 \)). In either cases, \( h \in U_{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, \varepsilon)}(g) \) but \( h \notin M(f, 1) \).

		      Hence \( M(f, 1) \) doesn't contain any basic open set in \( \mathscr{L} \).

		      Let \( g \in U_{(x_{0}, 1)}(f) \) in which \( 0 < x_{0} < 1 \) and \( \varepsilon > 0 \). We define a function \( k \in C \). We can pick a real number \( \delta \) such that \( 0 < \delta < \min\left\{ \dfrac{\varepsilon}{1 + \left\vert 1 - g(x_{0}) \right\vert}, x_{0}, 1 - x_{0} \right\} \). Define \( k \in C \) as a piecewise linear function
		      \[
			      k(x) = \begin{cases}
				      0                                                      & 0 \le x < x_{0} - \delta       \\
				      \frac{1 - g(x_{0})}{\delta}(x - x_{0}) + 1 - g(x_{0})  & x_{0} - \delta \le x \le x_{0} \\
				      -\frac{1 - g(x_{0})}{\delta}(x - x_{0}) + 1 - g(x_{0}) & x_{0} \le x \le x_{0} + \delta \\
				      0                                                      & x_{0} + \delta < x \le 1
			      \end{cases}
		      \]

		      then \( \int_{0}^{1}\left\vert k \right\vert = \delta\left\vert 1 - g(x_{0}) \right\vert < \dfrac{\varepsilon}{1 + \left\vert 1 - g(x_{0})\right\vert} \cdot \left\vert 1 - g(x_{0}) \right\vert < \varepsilon \) so if we define \( h = g + k \) then \( h \in M(g, \varepsilon) \). However, \( h(x_{0}) - f(x_{0}) = h(x_{0}) = k(x_{0}) + g(x_{0}) = (1 - g(x_{0})) + g(x_{0}) = 1 \), which means \( h \notin U_{(x_{0}, 1)}(f) \).

		      So \( U_{(x_{0}, 1)}(f) \) doesn't contain any basic open set in \( \mathscr{M} \).

		      Thus \( \mathscr{L} \) and \( \mathscr{M} \) are not related in the partial ordering of topologies in \( C \).

Let \( X \) be a partially ordered set {\color{red}with at least two distinct and comparable elements}. Let \( U_{L}(x) = \{y \mid y \prec x\} \) and \( U_{R}(x) = \{y \mid x \prec y\} \). Show:

	\item The discrete topology is the only one larger than \(\mathscr{T}_{L}\) and larger than \(\mathscr{T}_{R}\).

\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
		\item If \( U_{L}(x) \) and \( U_{L}(y) \) are not disjoint then there exists \( z \in U_{L}(x) \cap U_{L}(y) \). Because \( \prec \) is transitive, we deduce that \( U_{L}(z) \subset U_{L}(x) \) and \( U_{L}(z) \subset U_{L}(y) \), which implies \( U_{L}(z) \subset U_{L}(x) \cap U_{L}(y) \). Therefore \( \left\{ U_{L}(x) \right\} \) forms a basis for a topology \( \mathscr{T}_{L} \) in \( X \).

		      If \( U_{R}(x) \) and \( U_{R}(y) \) are not disjoint then there exists \( z \in U_{R}(x) \cap U_{R}(y) \). Because \( \prec \) is transitive, we deduce that \( U_{R}(z) \subset U_{R}(x) \) and \( U_{R}(z) \subset U_{R}(y) \), which implies \( U_{R}(z) \subset U_{R}(x) \cap U_{R}(y) \). Therefore \( \left\{ U_{R}(x) \right\} \) forms a basis for a topology \( \mathscr{T}_{R} \) in \( X \).
		\item If \( G \in \mathscr{T}_{L} \) then \( G \) is a union of sets of the form \( U_{L}(y) \). In other words, \( G = \bigcup_{y \in I} U_{L}(y) \). If \( x \in G \) then there exists \( y \in I \) such that \( x \in U_{L}(y) \) so \( U_{L}(x) \subset U_{L}(y) \subset G \).

		      Conversely, assume that \( x \in G \implies U_{L}(x) \subset G \) then \( G = \bigcup_{x\in G} U_{L}(x) \), which means \( G \in \mathscr{T}_{L} \) since \( \left\{ U_{L}(x) \right\} \) is a basis for \( \mathscr{T}_{L} \).
		\item Firstly, we show that the intersection of arbitrary many basic open sets in \( \mathscr{T}_{L} \) is a basic open set in \( \mathscr{T}_{L} \). Let \( S \) be a subset of \( X \) and \( U = \bigcap_{x\in S} U_{L}(x) \). If \( U \) is empty then it is open. Otherwise, for each \( y \in U \), \( U_{L}(y) \subset U_{L}(x) \) for every \( x \in S \) so for each \( y \in U \), \( U_{L}(y) \subset U \). Hence \( U \in \mathscr{T}_{L} \).
		\item Assume that \( \mathscr{T} \) is a topology on \( X \) containing both \( \mathscr{T}_{L} \) and \( \mathscr{T}_{R} \). Let \( x \) be an arbitrary element of \( X \) then \( \left\{ x \right\} = U_{L}(x) \cap U_{R}(x) \) (due to antisymmetry), which means \( \left\{ x \right\} \in \mathscr{T} \) for every \( x \in X \). Therefore \( \mathscr{T} \) is the discrete topology on \( X \). Conversely, the discrete topology on \( X \) contains both \( \mathscr{T}_{L} \) and \( \mathscr{T}_{R} \). Thus the discrete topology is the only one larger than both \( \mathscr{T}_{L} \) and \( \mathscr{L}_{R} \).
		\item Let \( a, b \) be two distinct and comparable elements of \( X \). Without loss of generality, assume that \( a \prec b \). Moreover, \( U_{L}(a) \notin \mathscr{T}_{R} \) and \( U_{R}(b) \notin \mathscr{T}_{L} \) (according to part (b)). Thus \(\mathscr{T}_{L}\) and \(\mathscr{T}_{R}\) are not related in the partial ordering of the topologies on \(X\).

\begin{problem}{III.3.7}
In \(\mathbb{Z}\), let \(p\) be a fixed prime. For each integer \(a > 0\), define \(U_{a}(n) = \{n + \lambda p^{a} \mid \lambda \in \mathbb{Z}\}\). Show that \(\{U_{a}(n)\}\) is a basis for some topology.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Assume that \( U_{a}(n) \cap U_{b}(m) \) is nonempty. Let \( x \in U_{a}(n) \cap U_{b}(m) \) then \( \lambda = \dfrac{x - n}{p^{a}} \) and \( \mu = \dfrac{x - m}{p^{b}} \) are integers. Without loss of generality, assume that \( a \le b \).

	\[ 0 = x - x = (n + \lambda p^{a}) - (m + \mu p^{b}) = (n - m) + (\lambda + \mu p^{b - a}) p^{a} \]

	so
	\[ m = n + (\lambda + \mu p^{b-a})p^{a} \in U_{a}(n) \]

	from which and \( a \le b \), we deduce that \( U_{b}(m) \subset U_{a}(n) \).

	Therefore \( U_{a}(n) \cap U_{b}(m) = U_{b}(m) \). Hence \( \left\{ U_{a}(n) \right\} \) is a basis for some topology.

Let \(\{\mathscr{T}_\alpha \mid \alpha \in \mathscr{A}\}\) be any family of topologies on \(X\). Define \(\bigvee_\alpha \mathscr{T}_\alpha\) to be the topology having \(\bigcup_\alpha \mathscr{T}_\alpha\) as subbasis.
\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
	\item Prove: \( \bigvee_{\alpha} \mathscr{T}_{\alpha} \) is the smallest of the topologies on \(X\) larger than every \( \mathscr{T}_{\alpha} \).
	\item Show that with the operations \( \mathscr{T}_{1} \vee \mathscr{T}_{2} \) and \( \mathscr{T}_{1} \cap \mathscr{T}_{2} \) that the topologies on \( X \) form a complete lattice.
	\item Is \( \mathscr{T}_{1} \cap (\mathscr{T}_{2} \vee \mathscr{T}_{3}) = (\mathscr{T}_{1} \cap \mathscr{T}_{2}) \vee (\mathscr{T}_{1} \cap \mathscr{T}_{3}) \) always true?
	\item What is \( \mathscr{T}_{L} \vee \mathscr{T}_{R} \) in Problem~\ref{problem:III.3.6}?
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
		\item \(\bigvee_\alpha \mathscr{T}_\alpha\) is the topology having \(\bigcup_\alpha \mathscr{T}_\alpha\) as subbasis so it is the smallest topology containing \(\bigcup_\alpha \mathscr{T}_\alpha\).

		      Assume that \( \mathscr{T} \) is a topology larger than every \( \mathscr{T}_{\alpha} \) then every finite intersection of open sets in \( \bigcup_{\alpha}\mathscr{T}_{\alpha} \) is in \( \mathscr{T} \) hence every union of finite intersections of open sets in \( \bigcup_{\alpha} U_{\alpha} \) is in \( \mathscr{T} \). Therefore \( \bigvee_\alpha \mathscr{T}_\alpha \subset \mathscr{T} \).

		      Thus \( \bigvee_\alpha \mathscr{T}_\alpha \) is the smallest of the topologies on \(X\) larger than every \( \mathscr{T}_{\alpha} \).
		\item Let \( T \) be a collection of topologies on \( X \).

		      \( \bigcap_{\mathscr{T} \in T} \mathscr{T} \) is the largest of the topologies on \( X \) smaller than every \( \mathscr{T} \in T \).

		      \( \bigvee_{\mathscr{T} \in T} \mathscr{T} \) is the smallest of the topologies on \( X \) larger than every \( \mathscr{T} \in T \).

		      Hence \( T \) has a greatest lower bound and a least upper bound, so the topologies on \(X\) with the partial ordering by inclusion form a complete lattice.
		\item No. It is not true in general. However, \( \mathscr{T}_{1} \cap (\mathscr{T}_{2} \vee \mathscr{T}_{3}) \supset (\mathscr{T}_{1} \cap \mathscr{T}_{2}) \vee (\mathscr{T}_{1} \cap \mathscr{T}_{3}) \) always holds.

\begin{problem}{III.3.9}
In the set \(\mathbb{R}\) of all real numbers, let \( \sigma \) consist of all sets of form \( \left\{ x \mid x > r \right\} \), \( \left\{ x \mid x < r \right\} \), where \( r, s \) are rational. Show that \( \mathscr{T}(\sigma) \) is the Euclidean topology of \( \mathbb{R} \). Is this still true if \( r, s \) are restricted to be numbers of the form \( k/2^{n} \) (\(k\) and \(n\) arbitrary {\color{red}integers})?
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	The open sets in \( \mathscr{T}(\sigma) \) are the unions of finite intersections of sets of the forms \( \left\{ x \mid x > r \right\} \) and \( \left\{ x \mid x < s \right\} \) in which \( r, s \) are rational. Hence the open sets in \( \mathscr{T}(\sigma) \) are the unions of sets of the form \( \openinterval{r, s} \), \( \left\{ x \mid x > r \right\} \), \( \left\{ x \mid x < s \right\} \) in which \( r, s \) are rational. So the collection \( \mathscr{C} \) of \( \openinterval{r, s} \), \( \left\{ x \mid x > r \right\} \), \( \left\{ x \mid x < s \right\} \) in which \( r, s \) are rational is a basis for \( \mathscr{T}(\sigma) \). For each \( C \in \mathscr{C} \) and for each \( x \in C \) there are \( a, b \in \mathbb{R} \) such that \( x \in \openinterval{a, b} \subset C \).

	The collection of open intervals is a basis for the Euclidean topology of \( \mathbb{R} \). Consider an open interval \( \openinterval{a, b} \) and an arbitrary \( x \in \openinterval{a, b} \). Since there is a rational number between two distinct real numbers, there exist rational numbers \( r \in \openinterval{a, x} \) and \( s \in \openinterval{x, b} \). Hence \( x \in \openinterval{r, s} \subset \openinterval{a, b} \).

	Thus \( \mathscr{T}(\sigma) \) is the Euclidean topology of \( \mathbb{R} \).

	The only property of rational numbers that we exploit in the above proof is that every open interval contains a rational number.

	We show that if two real numbers \( a, b \) are such that \( a < b \) then there exists a rational number of the form \( \dfrac{k}{2^{n}} \) in \( \openinterval{a, b} \). There exists an integer \( n \) such that \( \dfrac{1}{2^{n}} < b - a \) so \( 2^{n}a < 2^{n}a + 1 < 2^{n}b \). Let \( k = \left\lfloor 2^{n}a \right\rfloor + 1 \) then \( 2^{n}a < k \le 2^{n}a + 1 < 2^{n}b \), which implies \( a < \dfrac{k}{2^{n}} < b \).

	Hence every open interval contains a rational numbers of the form \( k/2^{n} \) (\(k\) and \(n\) are arbitrary integers). Thus the statement still holds if \( r, s \) are restricted to be numbers of the form \( k/2^{n} \) (\(k\) and \(n\) are arbitrary integers).

\section{Elementary concepts}

\begin{problem}{III.4.1}
Determine the closure, derived set, interior, and boundary, of the following sets: (a) The rationals in \( E^{1} \); (b) the Cantor set in \(E^{1}\); (c) the set
\[
	\left\{ (r_{1}, r_{2}) \mid r_{1}, r_{2} \in \mathbb{Q} \right\} \subset E^{2};
\]

(d) \( \left\{ (x, 0) \mid 0 < x < 1 \right\} \subset E^{2} \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)},itemsep=0pt]
		\item Let \( U \) be a nonempty open set of \( E^{1} \) then \( U \) contains an interval \( \openinterval{a, b} \) where \( a < b \). Since there is a rational number \( q \in \openinterval{a, b} \), we conclude that \( U \cap \mathbb{Q} \ne \varnothing \). Therefore \( \mathbb{Q} \) is dense in \( E^{1} \), which means the closure of \( \mathbb{Q} \) in \( E^{1} \) is \( \mathbb{R} \).

		      For every \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), for every neighborhood \( U \) of \( x \), there exist \( a, b \in \mathbb{R} \) such that \( x \in \openinterval{a, b} \subset U \). The interval \( \openinterval{x, b} \subset \openinterval{a, b} \) contains a rational number and it is other than \( x \). Hence \( x \) is in the derived set of \( \mathbb{Q} \) in \( E^{1} \). Therefore the derived set of \( \mathbb{Q} \) in \( E^{1} \) is \( \mathbb{R} \).

		      Let \( r \in \mathbb{Q} \). For every neighborhood \( U \) of \( r \), there exist \( a, b \in \mathbb{R} \) such that \( r \in \openinterval{a, b} \subset U \). However, \( \openinterval{a, b} \) intersects both \( \mathbb{Q} \) and \( \mathbb{R} - \mathbb{Q} \), which means \( \mathbb{Q} \) has empty interior. This implies that \( \mathbb{R} - \mathbb{Q} \) is dense in \( E^{1} \).

		      The boundary of \( \mathbb{Q} \) is \( E^{1} \) is \( \overline{\mathbb{Q}} \cap \overline{\mathscr{C}\mathbb{Q}} = \overline{\mathbb{Q}} \cap \overline{\mathbb{R} - \mathbb{Q}} = \mathbb{R} \cap \mathbb{R} = \mathbb{R} \).
		\item We repeat the definition of the Cantor set.

		      Starting with \( \closedinterval{0, 1} \), we remove the middle-third open interval \( M_{1} = \openinterval{\frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}} \).

		      Then we remove the middle-third open intervals from the remaining intervals \( \closedinterval{0, \frac{1}{3}} \) and \( \closedinterval{\frac{2}{3}, 1} \).

		      At the \( n \)-th stage, we remove the union \( M_{n} \) of the middle thirds of the remaining \( 2^{n-1} \) intervals.

		      The Cantor set is \( C = \closedinterval{0, 1} - \bigcup^{\infty}_{1} M_{n} \).

		      Since each \( M_{n} \) is open in \( E^{1} \), it follows that \( \bigcup^{\infty}_{1} M_{n} \) is open in \( E^{1} \), so \( C \) is closed in \( E^{1} \), which means the closure of \( C \) in \( E^{1} \) is \( C \).

		      Because \( C \) is closed in \( E^{1} \), the derived set of \( C \) is contained in \( C \). We will show that every point of \( C \) is a cluster point of \( C \). Let \( x \in C \) and \( U \) be a neighborhood of \(x\). There exists an open interval \( \openinterval{a, b} \) such that \( x \in \openinterval{a, b} \subset U \).
		      \[ C = \closedinterval{0, 1} - \bigcup^{\infty}_{1} M_{n} = \bigcap^{\infty}_{1}\left( \closedinterval{0, 1} - M_{n} \right) \]

		      For each \( n \), there exists a closed interval \( I_{n} \) in \( \closedinterval{0, 1} - M_{n} \) containing \( x \). We can choose a sufficiently large number \( n \) such that the length of \( I_{n} \) is less than \( x - a \) and \( b - x \). Hence \( x \in I_{n} \subset \openinterval{a, b} \). The endpoints of \( I_{n} \) are in \( C \) and other than \( x \) so \( \openinterval{a, b} \cap (C - \left\{x\right\}) \ne \varnothing \). Hence \( x \) is a cluster point of \( C \).

		      Thus the derived set of \( C \) is \( C \) itself.

		      Let \( x \) be a point in \( C \) and \( U \) a neighborhood of \( x \). Since \( U \) is open, there exists an open interval \( \openinterval{a, b} \) such that \( x \in \openinterval{a, b} \subset U \). The total length of closed intervals in \( \closedinterval{0, 1} - M_{n} \) is \( {(2/3)}^{n} \) and can be arbitrarily small, so there exists \( n \) such that \( {(2/3)}^{n} < b - a \), which implies \( \openinterval{a, b} \not\subset \closedinterval{0, 1} - M_{n} \) so \( \openinterval{a, b} \) is not contained in the Cantor set. Therefore \( C \) has empty interior.

		      The boundary of \( C \) is the complement of the interior of \( C \) in the closure of \( C \), so the boundary of \(C\) is \(C\) itself.
		\item The given set is dense in \( E^{2} \) so its closure is \( \mathbb{R}^{2} \).

		      Every point of \( E^{2} \) is a cluster point of the given set so its derived set is \( E^{2} \).

		      The interior of the given set is empty.

		      The boundary of the given set is \( \mathbb{R}^{2} \).
		\item The closure of the given set is \( \left\{ (x, 0) \mid 0 \le x \le 1 \right\} \).

		      The derived set of the given set is \( \left\{ (x, 0) \mid 0 \le x \le 1 \right\} \).

		      The interior of the given set is empty.

		      The boundary of the given set is \( \left\{ (x, 0) \mid 0 \le x \le 1 \right\} \).

Show that \( E^{s} \times 0 \subset E^{s} \times E^{t} = E^{s+t} \) is closed.

\begin{proof}
	Let \( x \in E^{s+t} - (E^{s}\times 0) \) and \( y \) be the orthogonal projection of \( x \) on \( E^{s} \times 0 \), then
	\[
		x \in B(x; \left\vert x - y \right\vert) \subset E^{s+t} - (E^{s}\times 0)
	\]

	which implies that \( E^{s+t} - (E^{s}\times 0) \) is open in \( E^{s+t} \). Hence \( E^{s}\times 0 \) is closed in \( E^{s+t} \).

Let \( A \subset E^{1} \) be a bounded set. Show \( \sup A \in \overline{A} \). Under what condition is \( \sup A \in A^{\prime} \)\@?
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	From the definition of supremum, any real number strictly less than \( \sup A \) is not an upper bound of \( A \). Let \( U \) be a neighborhood of \( \sup A \) then there exists an open interval \( \openinterval{a, b} \) such that \( \sup A \in \openinterval{a, b} \subset U \). Since \( a < \sup A \) then there exists \( x \in A \) such that \( a < x \), from which we deduce that \( a < x \le \sup A < b \). Hence \( U \cap A \ne \varnothing \), which means \( \sup A \in \overline{A} \).

	\( \sup A \in A^{\prime} \) if and only if for every \( x < \sup A \), there exists \( y \in A \) such that \( x < y < \sup A \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.4.4}
Prove: \(G\) is open in \(X\) if and only if \( \overline{G \cap \overline{A}} = \overline{G \cap A} \) for every \( A \subset X \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	\( G \) is open in \(X\) \( \implies \) \( \overline{G \cap \overline{A}} = \overline{G \cap A} \) for every \( A \subset X \).

	\( G \cap A \subset G \cap \overline{A} \) implies \( \overline{G \cap A} \subset \overline{G \cap \overline{A}} \). Assume that there exists \( x \in \overline{G \cap \overline{A}} \) such that \( x \notin \overline{G \cap A} \) then there is a neighborhood \(V\) of \(x\) such that \( V \cap (G \cap \overline{A}) \ne \varnothing \) and \( V \cap (G \cap \overline{A}) = \varnothing \). This is a contradiction, as any open set that intersects \( \overline{A} \) must intersects \( A \). Hence \( \overline{G \cap \overline{A}} = \overline{G \cap A} \).

	\( \overline{G \cap \overline{A}} = \overline{G \cap A} \) for every \( A \subset X \) \( \implies \)  \( G \) is open in \(X\).

	Choose \( A = \mathscr{C}G \) then \( \overline{G \cap \overline{\mathscr{C}G}} = \overline{G \cap (\mathscr{C}G)} = \overline{\varnothing} = \varnothing \). Therefore \( G \cap \overline{\mathscr{C}G} = \varnothing \). Moreover, \( \mathscr{C}\overline{\mathscr{C}G} = \operatorname{Int} G \) so \( G \subset \operatorname{Int} G \) and it follows from the definition of interior that \( G = \operatorname{Int} G \). Hence \( G \) is open in \( X \).
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.4.5}
Show that \( (A^{\prime} = \varnothing) \implies (A \text{ is closed}) \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Since \( \overline{A} = A \cup A^{\prime} \) it follows that \( A^{\prime} = \varnothing \) implies \( \overline{A} = A \), which means \( A \) is closed.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{III.4.6}
Let \(A = \left\{ 1/m + 1/n \mid m, n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \right\} \subset E^{1} \). Show that \( A^{\prime} = \left\{ 1/n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \right\} \cup \left\{ 0 \right\} \), \( A^{\prime\prime} = \left\{0\right\} \).
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
	Every number in \( \left\{ 1/n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \right\} \cup \left\{0\right\} \) is a cluster point of \(A\).

	Let \(x\) be a real number such that there is no positive integer \(n\) such that \( x = \dfrac{1}{n} \). If \( x < 0 \) or \( x \ge 2 \), \( x \) is not a cluster point of \(A\). Consider \( x \in \openinterval{0, 2} \).

	Let \(p\) be the largest positive integer such that \( x < \dfrac{1}{p} \) then \( \dfrac{1}{p+1} < x < \dfrac{1}{p} \). Hence there exists \( \varepsilon > 0 \) such that \( \openinterval{x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon} \) doesn't contain any rational number of the form \( \dfrac{1}{q} \).

	We will show that \( \openinterval{x - \varepsilon/2, x + \varepsilon/2} \) has at most finitely many numbers of the form \( 1/m + 1/n \) in which \( m \le n \). Assume that \( \dfrac{1}{m} + \dfrac{1}{n} \in \openinterval{x - \varepsilon/2, x + \varepsilon/2} \). Because \( \openinterval{x - \varepsilon, x + \varepsilon} \) has no rational number of the form \(1/a\), then
	\[ \dfrac{1}{n} \le \dfrac{1}{m} \le x - \varepsilon \]

	and
	\[ 0 < x - \dfrac{\varepsilon}{2} < \dfrac{1}{m} + \dfrac{1}{n} \le \dfrac{2}{m} \]

	Moreover
	\[
		x - \dfrac{\varepsilon}{2} < \dfrac{1}{m} + \dfrac{1}{n} < x - \varepsilon + \dfrac{1}{n}
	\]

	which implies \( n < \dfrac{2}{\varepsilon} \).

	Hence \( m < \dfrac{2}{x - \dfrac{\varepsilon}{2}} \) and \( n < \dfrac{2}{\varepsilon} \), which means there are at most finitely many rational numbers of the form \( 1/m + 1/n \) in \( \openinterval{x - \dfrac{\varepsilon}{2}, x + \dfrac{\varepsilon}{2}} \). Hence \( x \) is not a cluster point of \(A\), thus \( A^{\prime} = \left\{ 1/n \mid n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+} \right\} \cup \left\{0\right\} \).

	The only cluster point of \(A^{\prime}\) is 0 so \( A^{\prime\prime} = \left\{0\right\} \).

\maketitle

These are my notes that I wrote as I was reading ``Linear Algebra'' (Kenneth Hoffman and Ray Kunze). I write this mainly for myself, so it might be not suitable for someone to start studying Linear Algebra from these notes only. Instead, I advise readers to use the note as a companion with the book of Hoffman and Kunze.

I have already had experience with Linear Algebra. Prior to the book of Hoffman and Kunze, I had studied Linear Algebra with the textbook used at a class course. But I didn't find that textbooks/curriculum at my former university very friendly. After some trying and reading many reviews, I decided to choose this classic to refresh my mind.

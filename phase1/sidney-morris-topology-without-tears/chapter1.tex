\begin{exercise}
    Let $(X, \tau)$ be any topological space. Verify that \color{blue}{the intersection of any finite number of members of $\tau$ is a member of $\tau$}.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    The intersection of $0$ members of $\tau$ is $\varnothing$, which is a member of $\tau$.

    Assume that the intersection of $n$ members of $\tau$ is a member of $\tau$ (where $n$ is a nonnegative integer). From $(n+1)$ members of $\tau$, we pick out $n$ members. Due to the induction hypothesis, the intersection of these $n$ members is a member of $\tau$ --- denote the intersection by $A$. Due to the definition of topological space, the intersection of $A$ and the rest member is again a member of $\tau$. Therefore, the intersection of $(n+1)$ members of $\tau$ is a member of $\tau$.

    Thus, according to the principle of mathematical induction, the intersection of any finite number of members of $\tau$ is a member of $\tau$.

    \begin{enumerate}[label={(\roman*)}]
        \item $\tau_{1}$ consists of $\mathbb{R}$, $\varnothing$, and every interval $(-n, n)$, for $n$ any positive integer, where $(-n, n)$ denotes that set $\{ x\in\mathbb{R} : -n < x < n \}$;
        \item $\tau_{2}$ consists of $\mathbb{R}$, $\varnothing$, and every interval $[-n, n]$, for $n$ any positive integer, where $[-n, n]$ denotes that set $\{ x\in\mathbb{R} : -n \leq x \leq n \}$;

        \item $\tau_{3}$ consists of $\mathbb{R}$, $\varnothing$, and every interval $[n, \infty)$, for $n$ any positive integer, where $[n, \infty)$ denotes that set $\{ x\in\mathbb{R} : n\leq x \}$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}[label={(\roman*)}]
        \item A union of a finite number of members of $\tau_{1}$ is a member of $\tau_{1}$, because
              \[
                  \bigcup^{m}_{k=1} (-n_{k}, n_{k}) = (-n, n)
              \]

              where $n = \max\{ n_{1}, n_{2}, \ldots, n_{m} \}$. A union of infinite members of $\tau_{1}$ is $\mathbb{R}$, because
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item $\bigcup^{\infty}_{k=1} (-n_{k}, n_{k})\subseteq \mathbb{R}$
                  \item Let $x$ be a real number. Due to the Archimedean property, there exists a natural number $n$ such that $x < n$. From infinite members of $\tau_{1}$, there exists a natural number $n_{k}$ such that $n\leq n_{k}$, so that $x\in (-n, n)\subseteq (-n_{k}, n_{k})$. So $\mathbb{R}\subseteq \bigcup^{\infty}_{k=1} (-n_{k}, n_{k})$.
              \end{itemize}

              The intersection of any two members of $\tau_{1}$ is a member of $\tau_{1}$, because
              \[
                  (-n_{1}, n_{1})\cap (-n_{2}, n_{2}) = (-n, n)
              \]

              where $n = \min\{ n_{1}, n_{2} \}$.

              Hence $\tau_{1}$ is a topology on $\mathbb{R}$.
        \item A union of a finite number of members of $\tau_{2}$ is a member of $\tau_{2}$, because
              \[
                  \bigcup^{m}_{k=1} [-n_{k}, n_{k}] = [-n, n]
              \]

              where $n = \max\{ n_{1}, n_{2}, \ldots, n_{m} \}$. A union of infinite members of $\tau_{2}$ is $\mathbb{R}$, because
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item $\bigcup^{\infty}_{k=1} [-n_{k}, n_{k}]\subseteq \mathbb{R}$
                  \item Let $x$ be a real number. Due to the Archimedean property, there exists a natural number $n$ such that $x < n$. From infinite members of $\tau_{2}$, there exists a natural number $n_{k}$ such that $n\leq n_{k}$, so that $x\in [-n, n]\subseteq [-n_{k}, n_{k}]$. So $\mathbb{R}\subseteq \bigcup^{\infty}_{k=1} [-n_{k}, n_{k}]$.
              \end{itemize}

              The intersection of any two members of $\tau_{2}$ is a member of $\tau_{2}$, because
              \[
                  [-n_{1}, n_{1}]\cap [-n_{2}, n_{2}] = [-n, n]
              \]

              where $n = \min\{ n_{1}, n_{2} \}$.

              Hence $\tau_{2}$ is a topology on $\mathbb{R}$.
        \item A union of members of $\tau_{3}$, $\bigcup_{n\in A} [n, \infty)$ (where $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$) is a member of $\tau_{3}$, because
              \begin{itemize}
                  \item if $A = \varnothing$, then the union is the empty set.
                  \item if $A\ne\varnothing$, then $A$ has a least element --- let it be $a$, then $\bigcup_{n\in A} [n, \infty) = [a, \infty)$.
              \end{itemize}

              The intersection of any two members of $\tau_{3}$ is a member of $\tau_{3}$, because
              \[
                  [n_{1}, \infty) \cap [n_{2}, \infty) = [n, \infty)
              \]

              where $n = \min\{ n_{1}, n_{2} \}$.

              where $n = \max\{ n_{1}, n_{2}, \ldots, n_{k} \}$. A union of infinite members of $\tau_{1}$ is $\mathbb{N}$, which is a member of $\tau_{1}$.

\begin{exercise}
    Let $X$ be an infinite set and $\tau$ a topology on $X$. If every infinite subset of $X$ is in $\tau$, prove that $\tau$ is the discrete topology.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    Let $x$ be an element of $X$. $A = X\setminus\{ x \}$ is an infinite set.

    Because $A$ is an infinite set, then $A$ contains a countable subset $B = \{ x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, \ldots \}$. Let $C = \{ x_{2}, x_{4}, x_{6}, \ldots \}$, then $C$, $A\setminus C$ is a partition of $A$, where both $C$ and $A\setminus C$ are infinite sets.

    According to the hypothesis, $\{ x \}\cup C$ and $\{ x \}\cup (A\setminus C)$ are members of $\tau$, since they are infinite subsets of $X$. Therefore, the intersection of these two members is again a member of $\tau$. So $\{ x \}$ is a member of $\tau$ --- Furthermore, $x$ is an arbitrary element of $X$, so $\tau$ contains all singleton subsets of $X$.

    Hence $\tau$ is the discrete topology.

    Let $\mathbb{R}$ be the set of all real numbers. Precisely three of the following ten collections of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are topologies. Identify these and justify your answer.
    \begin{enumerate}[label={(\roman*)}]
        \item $\tau_{1}$ consists of $\mathbb{R}$, $\varnothing$, and every interval $(a, b)$, for $a$ and $b$ any real numbers with $a < b$;
        \item $\tau_{2}$ consists of $\mathbb{R}$, $\varnothing$, and every interval $(-r, r)$, for $r$ any positive real number;
        \item $\tau_{3}$ consists of $\mathbb{R}$, $\varnothing$, and every interval $(-r, r)$, for $r$ any positive rational number;
        \item $\tau_{4}$ consists of $\mathbb{R}$, $\varnothing$, and every interval $[-r, r]$, for $r$ any positive rational number;
        \item $\tau_{5}$ consists of $\mathbb{R}$, $\varnothing$, and every interval $(-r, r)$, for $r$ any positive irrational number;
        \item $\tau_{6}$ consists of $\mathbb{R}$, $\varnothing$, and every interval $[-r, r]$, for $r$ any positive irrational number;

        \item $\tau_{9}$ consists of $\mathbb{R}$, $\varnothing$, every interval $[-r, r]$, and every interval $(-r, r)$, for $r$ any positive real number;
        \item $\tau_{10}$ consists of $\mathbb{R}$, $\varnothing$, every interval $[-n, n]$, and every interval $(-r, r)$, for $n$ any positive integer and $r$ any positive real number.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    In this list, only $\tau_{2}$, $\tau_{9}$, $\tau_{10}$ are topologies on $\mathbb{R}$.

    \begin{enumerate}[label={(\roman*)}]
        \item \textbf{$\tau_{1}$ is not a topology on $\mathbb{R}$}. Because the union of $(1, 2)$ and $(3, 4)$ is not a member of $\tau_{1}$.
        \item A union of members of $\tau_{2}$ is of the form
              \[
                  A = \bigcup_{r\in S} (-r, r)
              \]

              where $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}_{> 0}$. Then $\bigcup_{r\in S} (-r, r)\subseteq \mathbb{R}$.
              \begin{enumerate}[label={\textbf{Case \arabic*.}},itemindent=1cm]
                  \item $S = \varnothing$.

                        Then the union is the empty set, which is a member of $\tau_{2}$.
                  \item $S$ is bounded from above.

                        According to the axiom of completeness, $S$ has a least upper bound. Let $u = \sup S$. Let $u'$ be a real number such that $u' < u$, then $u'$ is not the least upper bound of $S$, so there exists $a\in S$ such that $u' < a$. Therefore $u'$ is not an upper bound of $A$.

                        $u$ is indeed an upper bound of $A$, and every real number strictly less than $u$ is not an upper bound of $A$. So $u = \sup A$. On the other hand, $-u$ is a lower bound of $A$. Let $v$ be a real number such that $v > -u$, then $-v < u$. Because $u = \sup A$, then $-v < \sup A$, and there exists $a\in A$ such that $a < -v$, which is equivalent to $v > -a\geq -\abs{a}$. So $v$ is not a lower bound of $A$. Therefore, $-u$ is the greatest lower bound of $A$. Hence $A \subseteq (-u, u)$.

                        Let $x$ be an element of $(-u, u)$, then $-u < x < u$ and $-u < -\abs{x}\leq \abs{x} < u$. Then $\abs{x}$ is not an upper bound of $S$, so there exists $s\in S$ such that $\abs{x} < s$. Therefore, $x\in (-s, s)\subseteq A$. Hence $(-u, u)\subseteq A$.

                        So $A = (-u, u)$, which is a member of $\tau_{2}$.
                  \item $S$ is not bounded from above.

                        Then $A$ is not bounded from above.

                        Because $A$ is not bounded from above, and $r\in A\Longleftrightarrow -r\in A$ so $A$ is not bounded from below either. Let $x$ be a real number. Since $A$ is unbounded, then there exist real numbers $r$ and $r'$ in $A$ such that $r' < x < r$. Let $r_{0} = \max\{ \abs{r}, \abs{r'} \}$ ($r_{0}\in A$, because $r, r', -r, -r'\in A$). Since $S$ is not bounded from above, there exists $s\in S$ such that $r_{0} < s$, then $x\in (-r_{0}, r_{0})\subseteq (-s, s)\subseteq A$. So $\mathbb{R}\subseteq A$.

                        Hence $A = \mathbb{R}$, which is a member of $\tau_{2}$.
              \end{enumerate}

              Hence the union of arbitrary members in $\tau_{2}$ is again a member of $\tau_{2}$.

              Let's consider the intersection of arbitrary two members $A, B$ in $\tau_{2}$
              \begin{enumerate}[label={\textbf{Case \arabic*.}},itemindent=1cm]
                  \item $A = \varnothing$ or $B = \varnothing$.

                        $A\cap B = \varnothing$, which is a member of $\tau_{2}$.
                  \item $A = \mathbb{R}$ or $B = \mathbb{R}$.

                        If $A = \mathbb{R}$, then $A\cap B = B$, which is a member of $\tau_{2}$.

                        If $B = \mathbb{R}$, then $A\cap B = A$, which is a member of $\tau_{2}$.
                  \item $A = (-r_{1}, r_{1})$ and $B = (-r_{2}, r_{2})$.

                        Let $r = \min\{ r_{1}, r_{2} \}$, then $A\cap B = (-r, r)$, which is a member of $\tau_{2}$.
              \end{enumerate}

              Hence the intersection of any two members of $\tau_{2}$ is a member of $\tau_{2}$.

              Thus \textbf{$\tau_{2}$ is a topology on $\mathbb{R}$}.
        \item Let $S = \{ r\in\mathbb{Q} \mid 0 < r < \sqrt{2} \}$. From the definition of $S$, we deduce that
              \[
                  \bigcup_{r\in S} (-r, r)\subseteq (-\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2}).
              \]

              Let $x$ be an element of $(-\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2})$. According to the density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$, there exist rational numbers $q$ and $q'$ such that $-\sqrt{2} < q < x$ and $x < q' < \sqrt{2}$. Since $-\sqrt{2} < q, q' < \sqrt{2}$, then $\abs{q} < \sqrt{2}, \abs{q'} < \sqrt{2}$. Once again, according to the density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$, there exist rational numbers $q_{0}$ such that $\max\{ \abs{q}, \abs{q'} \} < q_{0} < \sqrt{2}$. So $q_{0}\in S$ and $x\in (-q_{0}, q_{0})\subseteq \bigcup_{r\in S} (-r, r)$, from which we deduce that $(-\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2})\subseteq \bigcup_{r\in S}(-r, r)$.

              Hence $\bigcup_{r\in S} (-r, r) = (-\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2})$, which is not a member of $\tau_{3}$.

              Thus \textbf{$\tau_{3}$ is not a topology on $\mathbb{R}$}.
        \item Let $S = \{ r\in\mathbb{Q} \mid -\sqrt{2} < r < 2 \}$. From the definition of $S$, we deduce that
              \[
                  \bigcup_{r\in S} [-r, r]\subseteq (-\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2}).
              \]

              Let $x$ be an element of $(-\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2})$. According to the density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$, there exist rational numbers $q$ and $q'$ such that $-\sqrt{2} < q < x$ and $x < q' < \sqrt{2}$. Since $-\sqrt{2} < q, q' < \sqrt{2}$, then $\abs{q} < \sqrt{2}, \abs{q'} < \sqrt{2}$. Once again, according to the density of $\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$, there exist rational numbers $q_{0}$ such that $\max\{ \abs{q}, \abs{q'} \} < q_{0} < \sqrt{2}$. So $q_{0}\in S$ and $x\in [-q_{0}, q_{0}]\subseteq \bigcup_{r\in S} [-r, r]$, from which we deduce that $(-\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2})\subseteq \bigcup_{r\in S}[-r, r]$.

              Hence $\bigcup_{r\in S} [-r, r] = (-\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2})$, which is not a member of $\tau_{4}$.

              Thus \textbf{$\tau_{4}$ is not a topology on $\mathbb{R}$}.
        \item Let $S = \{ s\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q} \mid 0 < s < 1 \}$. From the definition of $S$, we deduce that
              \[
                  \bigcup_{s\in S} (-s, s)\subseteq (-1, 1).
              \]

              Let $x$ be an element of $(-1, 1)$. According to the density of $\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$, there exist irrational numbers $a$ and $a'$ such that $-1 < a < x$ and $x < a' < 1$. Since $-1 < a, a' < 1$, then $\abs{a} < 1, \abs{a'} < 1$. Once again, according to the density of $\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$, there exist irrational number $a_{0}$ such that $\max\{ \abs{a}, \abs{a'} \} < a_{0} < 1$. So $a_{0}\in S$ and $x\in (-a_{0}, a_{0})\subseteq \bigcup_{s\in S} (-s, s)$, from which we deduce that $(-1, 1)\subseteq \bigcup_{s\in S}(-s, s)$.

              Hence $\bigcup_{s\in S} (-s, s) = (-1, 1)$, which is not a member of $\tau_{5}$.

              Thus \textbf{$\tau_{5}$ is not a topology on $\mathbb{R}$}.
        \item Let $S = \{ s\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q} \mid 0 < s < 1 \}$. From the definition of $S$, we deduce that
              \[
                  A = \bigcup_{s\in S} [-s, s]\subseteq (-1, 1).
              \]

              Let $x$ be an element of $(-1, 1)$. According to the density of $\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$, there exist irrational numbers $a$ and $a'$ such that $-1 < a < x$ and $x < a' < 1$. Since $-1 < a, a' < 1$, then $\abs{a} < 1, \abs{a'} < 1$. Once again, according to the density of $\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}$ in $\mathbb{R}$, there exist irrational number $a_{0}$ such that $\max\{ \abs{a}, \abs{a'} \} < a_{0} < 1$. So $a_{0}\in S$ and $x\in [-a_{0}, a_{0}]\subseteq A$, from which we deduce that $(-1, 1)\subseteq A$.

              Hence $A = (-1, 1)$, which is not a member of $\tau_{6}$.

              Thus \textbf{$\tau_{6}$ is not a topology on $\mathbb{R}$}.
        \item Let $S = \{ s\in\mathbb{R} \mid 0 < s < 1 \}$. From the definition of $S$, we deduce that
              \[
                  A = \bigcup_{s\in S} [-s, s) \subseteq (-1, 1)
              \]

              Let $x$ be an element of $(-1, 1)$. According to the density of $\mathbb{R}$, there exist real numbers $a$ and $a'$ such that $-1 < a < x$ and $x < a' < 1$. Since $-1 < a, a' < 1$, then $\abs{a} < 1$, $\abs{a'} < 1$. According to the density of $\mathbb{R}$, there exists a real number $a_{0}$ such that $\max\{ \abs{a}, \abs{a'} \} < a_{0} < 1$. So $a_{0}\in S$ and $x\in [-a_{0}, a_{0})\subseteq A$.

              Hence $A = (-1, 1)$, which is not a member of $\tau_{7}$.

              Thus \textbf{$\tau_{7}$ is not a topology on $\mathbb{R}$}.
        \item Let $S = \{ s\in\mathbb{R} \mid 0 < s < 1 \}$. From the definition of $S$, we deduce that
              \[
                  A = \bigcup_{s\in S} (-s, s] \subseteq (-1, 1)
              \]

              Let $x$ be an element of $(-1, 1)$. According to the density of $\mathbb{R}$, there exist real numbers $a$ and $a'$ such that $-1 < a < x$ and $x < a' < 1$. Since $-1 < a, a' < 1$, then $\abs{a} < 1$, $\abs{a'} < 1$. According to the density of $\mathbb{R}$, there exists a real number $a_{0}$ such that $\max\{ \abs{a}, \abs{a'} \} < a_{0} < 1$. So $a_{0}\in S$ and $x\in (-a_{0}, a_{0}]\subseteq A$.

              Hence $A = (-1, 1)$, which is not a member of $\tau_{8}$.

              Thus \textbf{$\tau_{8}$ is not a topology on $\mathbb{R}$}.
        \item A union of members of $\tau_{9}$ is of the form
              \[
                  A\cup B = \bigcup_{s\in S} [-s, s] \cup \bigcup_{r\in S'} (-r, r)
              \]

              where $S, S'\subseteq\mathbb{R}$, $A =  \bigcup_{s\in S} [-s, s]$ and $B =  \bigcup_{r\in S'} (-r, r)$.
              \begin{enumerate}[label={\textbf{Case \arabic*.}},itemindent=1cm]
                  \item $S = \varnothing$.

                        According to (ii), $A\cup B$ is a member of $\tau_{9}$.
                  \item $S$ is bounded from above, $S$ does not have maximum element, $S' = \varnothing$.

                        Let $u = \sup S$, then $u = \sup A$ and $-u = \inf A$. So $A\cup B = A\subseteq (-u, u)$.

                        Let $x$ be an element of $(-u, u)$, then $-u < x < u$. Because $x$ is not the least upper bound nor greatest lower bound of $A$, then there exist $a$, $a'$ in $A$ such that $-u < a < x$ and $x < a' < u$. Because $a$, $a'$ are elements of $A$, then there exist $s_{1}$, $s_{2}$ in $S$ such that $a\in [-s_{1}, s_{1}]$ and $a'\in [-s_{2}, s_{2}]$. Let $s_{0} = \max\{ s_{1}, s_{2} \}$, then $s_{0}\in S$ and $x\in [-s_{0}, s_{0}]$. Therefore $(-u, u)\subseteq A$.

                        Hence $A\cup B = A = (-u, u)$, which is a member of $\tau_{9}$.
                  \item $S$ is bounded from above, $S$ does not have maximum element, $S'$ is bounded from above.

                        Let $u = \sup S$, then $u = \sup A$ and $-u = \inf A$. According to \textbf{Case 2}, $A = (-u, u)$.

                        Let $u' = \sup S'$, then $u' = \sup B$ and $-u' = \inf B$. According to (ii), $B = (-u', u')$.

                        Let $u_{0} = \max\{ u, u' \}$, then $A\cup B = (-u_{0}, u_{0})$, which is a member of $\tau_{9}$.
                  \item $S$ has maximum element, $S' = \varnothing$.

                        Let $u = \max S$, then $u = \max A$ and $-u = \min A$, then $A = [-u, u]$.

                        $A\cup B = A = [-u, u]$, which is a member of $\tau_{9}$.
                  \item $S$ has maximum element, $S'$ is bounded from above.
                        Let $u = \max S$, then $u = \max A$ and $-u = \min A$, then $A = [-u, u]$.

                        Let $u' = \sup S'$, then $u' = \sup B$ and $-u' = \inf B$. According to (ii), $B = (-u', u')$.

                        If $u\geq u'$, then $A\cup B = [-u, u]$, which is a member of $\tau_{9}$.

                        If $u < u'$, then $A\cup B = (-u', u')$, which is a member of $\tau_{9}$.
                  \item $S$ is not bounded from above or $S'$ is not bounded from above.

                        In this case, $A\cup B = \mathbb{R}$, which is a member of $\tau_{9}$.
              \end{enumerate}

              So the union of arbitrary members of $\tau_{9}$ is again a member of $\tau_{9}$.

              Let's consider the intersection of arbitrary two members $X$, $Y$ in $\tau_{9}$.
              \begin{enumerate}[label={\textbf{Case \arabic*.}},itemindent=1cm]
                  \item $X = \varnothing$ or $Y = \varnothing$.

                        $X\cap Y = \varnothing$, which is a member of $\tau_{9}$.
                  \item $X = \mathbb{R}$ or $Y = \mathbb{R}$.

                        If $X = \mathbb{R}$, then $X\cap Y = Y$, which is a member of $\tau_{9}$.

                        If $Y = \mathbb{R}$, then $X\cap Y = X$, which is a member of $\tau_{9}$.
                  \item $X = (-r, r)$ and $Y = (-r', r')$.

                        Let $r_{0} = \min\{ r, r' \}$, then $X\cap Y = (-r_{0}, r_{0})$, which is a member of $\tau_{9}$.
                  \item $X = [-r, r]$ and $Y = [-r', r']$.

                        Let $r_{0} = \min\{ r, r' \}$, then $X\cap Y = [-r_{0}, r_{0}]$, which is a member of $\tau_{9}$.
                  \item $X = (-r, r)$ and $Y = [-r', r']$.

                        If $r'\geq r$, then $X\cap Y = (-r, r)$, which is a member of $\tau_{9}$.

                        If $r' < r$, then $X\cap Y = [-r', r']$, which is a member of $\tau_{9}$.
              \end{enumerate}

              So the intersection of arbitrary two members of $\tau_{9}$ is again a member of $\tau_{9}$.

              Thus \textbf{$\tau_{9}$ is a topology on $\mathbb{R}$}.
        \item A union of members of $\tau_{10}$ is of the form
              \[
                  A\cup B = \bigcup_{n\in S} [-n, n] \cup \bigcup_{r\in S'} (-r, r)
              \]

              where $S\subseteq\mathbb{Z}_{> 0}$, $S'\subseteq\mathbb{R}$, $A = \bigcup_{n\in S} [-n, n]$ and $B = \bigcup_{r\in S'} (-r, r)$.
              \begin{enumerate}[label={\textbf{Case \arabic*.}},itemindent=1cm]
                  \item $S = \varnothing$.

                        According to (ii), $A\cup B = B$ is a member of $\tau_{10}$.
                  \item $S$ is bounded from above.
                        $S$ is a subset of $\mathbb{Z}_{> 0}$ and $S$ is bounded from above, so that $S$ has a maximum element --- Let the maximum element be $a$ ($a$ is a positive integer), then $A = [-a, a]$.
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item if $S' = \varnothing$, then $A\cup B = [-a, a]$.
                            \item if $S'$ is bounded from above, then $B = (-u', u')$ (where $u' = \sup B$, according to (ii)). If $a\geq u'$, then $A\cup B = [-a, a]$. If $a < u'$, then $A\cup B = (-u', u')$.
                            \item if $S'$ is not bounded from above, then $B = \mathbb{R}$, and $A\cup B = \mathbb{R}$.
                        \end{itemize}

                        In any of these three cases, $A\cup B$ is a member of $\tau_{10}$.
                  \item $S$ is not bounded from above.

                        Then $A = \mathbb{R}$, so $A\cup B = \mathbb{R}$, which is a member of $\tau_{10}$.
              \end{enumerate}

              So the union of arbitrary members of $\tau_{10}$ is again a member of $\tau_{10}$.

              Let's consider the intersection of two arbitrary members $X$, $Y$ of $\tau_{10}$.
              \begin{enumerate}[label={\textbf{Case \arabic*.}},itemindent=1cm]
                  \item $X = \varnothing$ or $Y = \varnothing$.

                        $X\cap Y = \varnothing$, which is a member of $\tau_{10}$.
                  \item $X = [-n, n]$ and $Y = (-r, r)$.

                        If $n\geq r$, then $X\cap Y = (-r, r)$, which is a member of $\tau_{10}$.

                        If $n < r$, then $X\cap Y = [-n, n]$, which is a member of $\tau_{10}$.
                  \item $X = \mathbb{R}$ or $Y = \mathbb{R}$.

                        If $X = \mathbb{R}$, then $X\cap Y = Y$, which is a member of $\tau_{10}$.

                        If $Y = \mathbb{R}$, then $X\cap Y = X$, which is a member of $\tau_{10}$.
              \end{enumerate}

              So the intersection of two arbitrary members of $\tau_{10}$ is again a member of $\tau_{10}$.

              Thus \textbf{$\tau_{10}$ is a topology on $\mathbb{R}$}.

    Let $(X, \tau)$ be a topological space with the property that every subset is closed. Prove that it is a discrete space.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    Let $S$ be a subset of $X$, then $X\setminus S$ is also a subset of $X$. According to the hypothesis, $S$ and $X\setminus S$ are closed. Due to the definition of open sets, $S$ and $X\setminus S$ are open. Therefore every subset of $X$ is open. Hence $(X, \tau)$ is a discrete topological space.

\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    Let $\tau_{1} = \{ X, \varnothing, \{ a \}, \{ b, c, d \} \}$. Then $\tau_{1}$ is a topology on $X$, and every open set in $(X, \tau_{1})$ is clopen.

    Let $X$ be an infinite set. If $\tau$ is a topology on $X$ such that every infinite subset of $X$ is closed, prove that $\tau$ is the discrete topology.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    Let $x$ be an element of $X$. Since $X$ is an infinite set, then $X\setminus\{ x \}$ is also an infinite set, therefore closed (due to the hypothesis). According to the definition of closed sets, $\{ x \}$ is open. So every singleton subset of $X$ is open. Hence $\tau$ is the discrete topology.

\begin{proof}
    No.

    For example: $X = \mathbb{N}$, $\tau = \{ \mathbb{N}, \varnothing, \{ 1 \} \}$. The only infinite subset of $X$ which is open is $X$, but $(X, \tau)$ is not an indiscrete space.

              \[
                  (a) B = X\setminus A;\qquad (b) A\subset B;\qquad (c) B\subset A.

    \begin{enumerate}[label={(\roman*)}]
        \item Since $\tau$ is a topology on $X$, then $A\cup B$ and $A\cap B$ are members of $\tau$.

              If $A\cap B = \varnothing$, then $A\cup B\ne \varnothing$, $A\cup B\ne A$, $A\cup B\ne B$. Therefore $A\cup B = X$. Together with $A\cap B = \varnothing$, we obtain that $B = X\setminus A$.

              If $A\cap B\ne \varnothing$, then either $A\cap B = A$ or $A\cap B = B$. Equivalently, either $A\subset B$ or $B\subset A$.

              Hence either $B = X\setminus A$, or $A\subset B$, or $B\subset A$.

        \item As recorded in \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_topological_space}, the number of distinct topologies on a set with $n \in \mathbb{N}$ points can be very large even for small $n$; namely when $n = 2$, there are $4$ topologies; when $n = 3$, there are $29$ topologies; when $n = 4$, there are $355$ topologies; when $n = 5$, there are $6942$ topologies etc. Using mathematical induction, prove that as $n$ increases, the number of topologies increases.
        \item Using mathematical induction prove that if the finite set $X$ has $n\in\mathbb{N}$ points, then it has at least $(n - 1){!}$ distinct topologies.
        \item If $X$ is any infinite set of cardinality $\aleph$, prove that there are at least $2^{\aleph}$ distinct topologies on $X$. Deduce that every infinite set has an uncountable number of distinct topologies on it.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}[label={(\roman*)}]
        \item When $n = 1$, a set of $1$ element has $1$ topology.

              Assume that a set of $n$ element has $M$ topologies. Let's consider a set of $(n+1)$ elements $S = \{ a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}, a_{n+1} \}$.

              For each topology $\tau$ on $S\setminus\{ a_{n+1} \}$, $\tau\cup\{ S \}$ is a topology on $S$. On the other hand, $\{ S, \varnothing, \{ a_{n+1} \}, S\setminus\{ a_{n+1} \} \}$ is also a topology on $S$. So $S$ has at least $M+1$ topologies.
        \item When $n = 1$, a set of $1$ element has $1 = (1-1){!}$ topology.

              Assume that a set of $k$ element has at least $(k-1){!}$ topologies. Let's consider a set of $(k+1)$ elements $S = \{ a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{k}, a_{k+1} \}$. Let $M$ be the number of topologies on $S\setminus\{a_{k+1}\}$.

              For each topology $\tau$ on $S\setminus\{ a_{k+1} \}$, for each $i = 1, 2, \ldots, k$, $\tau\cup\{ S, \varnothing, \{ a_{i}, a_{k+1} \}, S\setminus\{ a_{i}, a_{k+1} \} \}$ is a topology on $S$. So there are at least $M\cdot k$ topologies on $S$. According to the induction hypothesis, $M\geq (k-1){!}$, so there are at least $k{!}$ topologies on $S$.

              Thus, according to the principle of mathematical induction, a set of $n$ elements has at least $(n-1){!}$ topologies.
        \item Let $S$ be a subset of $X$, then $\{ X, \varnothing, S \}$ is a topology on $X$. Since $\abs{X} = \aleph$, then $X$ has $2^{\aleph}$ distinct subsets. Therefore, $X$ has at least $2^{\aleph}$ topologies.

        \item Prove that (2) is true.
        \item Find (concrete) sets $A_{1}$, $A_{2}$, $X$, and $Y$ and a function $f: X\to Y$ such that $f(A_{1}\cap A_{2}) \ne f(A_{1})\cap f(A_{2})$, where $A_{1}\subseteq X$ and $A_{2}\subseteq X$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}[label={(\alph*)}]
        \item Suppose that $x\in f^{-1}\left( \bigcup_{j\in J} B_{j} \right)$. Then $f(x)\in \bigcup_{j\in J} B_{j}$. According to the definition of union of sets, there exists $i\in J$ such that $f(x)\in B_{i}$, equivalently, $x\in f^{-1}(B_{i})$. Therefore, $x\in \bigcup_{j\in J} f^{-1}(B_{j})$. So $f^{-1}\left(\bigcup_{j\in J} B_{j}\right) \subseteq \bigcup_{j\in J} f^{-1}(B_{j})$.

              Suppose that $x\in \bigcup_{j\in J} f^{-1}(B_{j})$. According to the definition of union of sets, there exists $i\in J$ such that $x\in f^{-1}(B_{i})$, equivalently, $f(x)\in B_{i}$. Therefore $f(x)\in \bigcup_{j\in J} B_{j}$, from which we deduce that $x\in f^{-1}\left( \bigcup_{j\in J} B_{j} \right)$. So $\bigcup_{j\in J} f^{-1}(B_{j}) \subseteq f^{-1}\left( \bigcup_{j\in J} B_{j} \right)$.

              Thus $f^{-1}\left( \bigcup_{j\in J} B_{j} \right) = \bigcup_{j\in J} f^{-1}(B_{j})$.
        \item Suppose that $x\in f^{-1}(B_{1}\cap B_{2})$. Then $f(x)\in B_{1}\cap B_{2}$, which means $f(x)\in B_{1}$ and $f(x)\in B_{2}$. Therefore $x\in f^{-1}(B_{1})$ and $x\in f^{-1}(B_{2})$, so $x\in f^{-1}(B_{1})\cap f^{-1}(B_{2})$. So $f^{-1}(B_{1}\cap B_{2})\subseteq f^{-1}(B_{1})\cap f^{-1}(B_{2})$.

              Suppose that $x\in f^{-1}(B_{1})\cap f^{-1}(B_{2})$. Then $x\in f^{-1}(B_{1})$ and $x\in f^{-1}(B_{2})$. Therefore $f(x)\in B_{1}$ and $f(x)\in B_{2}$, which means $f(x)\in B_{1}\cap B_{2}$, so $x\in f^{-1}(B_{1}\cap B_{2})$. So $f^{-1}(B_{1})\cap f^{-1}(B_{2})\subseteq f^{-1}(B_{1}\cap B_{2})$.

              Thus $f^{-1}(B_{1}\cap B_{2}) = f^{-1}(B_{1})\cap f^{-1}(B_{2})$.
        \item For example, $X = \mathbb{R}$, $Y = \mathbb{R}$, $A_{1} = \mathbb{R}_{> 0}$, $A_{2} = \mathbb{R}_{< 0}$, and $f: \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$, $f(x) = \abs{x}$.

              Then $f(A_{1})\cap f(A_{2}) = \mathbb{R}_{> 0}$, and $f(A_{1}\cap A_{2}) = \varnothing$. In this example, $f(A_{1}\cap A_{2})\ne f(A_{1})\cap f(A_{2})$.

    No. The final segment topology on $\mathbb{N}$ is not the finite-closed topology.

    Let $S = \{ 1, 3 \}$. The complement of $S$ is $\{ 2 \}\cup \{ n\in\mathbb{N} \mid n\geq 4 \}$, which is not open. Therefore $S = \{ 1, 3 \}$ is not closed.

    \begin{enumerate}[label={(\roman*)}]
        \item Yes.

              Since in any discrete space, every singleton subset $\{ x \}$ is closed, due to its complement being open.
        \item No.

              Because in an indiscrete space with at least two points, any singleton subset is neither open nor closed.
        \item Yes.

              Any singleton subset of an infinite set with the finite-closed topology is finite, therefore closed.
        \item No.

              $X = \{ a, b, c, d, e, f \}$, $\tau_{1} = \{ X, \varnothing, \{ a \}, \{ c, d \}, \{ a, c, d \}, \{ b, c, d, e, f \} \}$. $(X, \tau_{1})$ is not a $T_{1}$-space because the subset $\{ b \}$ of $X$ is not closed.
        \item No.

              For any singleton subset $\{ x \}$ of $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{R}\setminus\{x\}$ is not an interval of the form $(-n, n)$ where $n$ is a positive integer.
        \item No.

              For any singleton subset $\{ x \}$ of $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{R}\setminus\{x\}$ is not an interval of the form $[-n, n]$ where $n$ is a positive integer.
        \item No.

              For any singleton subset $\{ x \}$ of $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{R}\setminus\{x\}$ is not an interval of the form $[n, \infty)$ where $n$ is a positive integer.
        \item No.

              For example, the singleton subset $\{ 2 \}$ is not closed because its complement $\{ 1 \}\cup \{ n\in\mathbb{N} \mid n\geq 3 \}$ is not open.
        \item No.

              For example, the singleton subset $\{ 2 \}$ is not closed because its complement $\{ 1 \}\cup \{ n\in\mathbb{N} \mid n\geq 3 \}$ is not open.

\begin{exercise}
    Let $\tau$ be the finite-closed topology on a set $X$. If $\tau$ is also the discrete topology, prove that the set $X$ is finite.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    Let $S$ be a finite subset of $X$. Since $\tau$ is the finite-closed topology on $X$, then $S$ is closed. Therefore, $X\setminus S$ is open. On the other hand, $\tau$ is also the discrete topology, then $S$ is also open. Therefore $X\setminus S$ is closed, which means $X\setminus S$ is finite due to $\tau$ being the finite-closed topology. Hence $X = S\cup X\setminus S$ is finite.

    A topological space $(X, \tau)$ is said to be a {\color{red}$T_{0}$-space} if for each pair of distinct points $a$, $b$ in $X$, either there exists an open set containing $a$ and not $b$, or there exists an open set containing $b$ and not $a$.
    \begin{enumerate}[label={(\roman*)}]
        \item Prove that every $T_{1}$-space is a $T_{0}$-space.
        \item Which of (i) $-$ (iv) in Exercise 3 above are $T_{0}$-spaces? (Justify your answer.)
        \item Put a topology $\tau$ on the set $X = \{ 0, 1 \}$ so that $(X, \tau)$ will be a $T_{0}$-space but not a $T_{1}$-space. [The topological space you obtain is called the {\color{red}Sierpinski space}.]
        \item Prove that each of the topological spaces described in Exercises 1.1 \#6 is a $T_{0}$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}[label={(\roman*)}]
        \item Let $a$ and $b$ be two arbitrary distinct points on the $T_{1}$-space $(X, \tau)$. Due to $(X, \tau)$ being a $T_{1}$-space, $\{ a \}$ and $\{ b \}$ are closed. Therefore, $X\setminus\{ a \}$ is open. On the other hand, $X\setminus\{ b \}$ contains $a$ but not $b$. Hence $(X, \tau)$ is also a $T_{0}$-space.
        \item Topological space in Exercise 3 (i) is a $T_{0}$-space. Because in any discrete space, for every two distinct points $a$, $b$, $\{ a \}$, $\{ b \}$ are open sets and $\{ a \}$ does not contain $b$.

              Topological space in Exercise 3 (ii) is not a $T_{0}$-space. Because in an indiscrete space, for every two distinct points $a$, $b$, there is no open set that contain $a$ but not $b$, there is no open set that contain $b$ but not $a$.

              Topological space in Exercise 3 (iii) is a $T_{0}$-space. Because in an infinite set with finite-closed topology, for every two distinct points $a$, $b$, the complement of $\{ a \}$ is open, which contains $b$ but not $a$.

              Topological space in Exercise 3 (iv) is not a $T_{0}$-space. Because there is no open set that contains $e$ but not $f$, there is no open set that contains $f$ but not $e$.
        \item $X = \{ 0, 1 \}$ $\tau = \{ X, \varnothing, \{ 0 \} \}$, then $(X, \tau)$ is a $T_{0}$-space but not a $T_{1}$-space.
        \item For any two distinct positive integer $m$, $n$, $\{ x\in\mathbb{N} \mid x\leq \min\{ m, n \} \}$ is an open set which contains $\min\{ m, n \}$ but not $\max\{ m, n \}$. So $\mathbb{N}$ with the initial segment topology is a $T_{0}$-space.

              For any two distinct positive integer $m$, $n$, $\{ x\in\mathbb{N} \mid x\geq \max\{ m, n \} \}$ is an open set which contains $\max\{ m, n \}$ but not $\min\{ m, n \}$. So $\mathbb{N}$ with the final segment topology is a $T_{0}$-space.

\begin{exercise}
    Let $X$ be any infinite set. The {\color{red}countable-closed topology} is defined to be the topology having as its closed sets $X$ and all countable (finite or countably infinite) subsets of $X$. Prove that this is indeed a topology on $X$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    $\varnothing$ and $X$ are closed sets.

    Let $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ be $X$ or countable subsets of $X$. If at least one of them is $X$, then $A_{1}\cup A_{2} = X$. If none of them is $X$, then $A_{1}\cup A_{2}$ is a countable subset of $X$ because the union of two countable sets is a countable set.

    Let ${(A_{i})}_{i\in I}$ be a family of sets. If this family contains countable subsets of $X$ only, then the intersection of this family is countable (since a subset of any countable set is also countable). Otherwise, this family contains $X$, then the intersection is either $X$ or a countable subset of $X$ (refer to the previous case).

    Hence the countable-closed topology is indeed a topology on the infinite set $X$.

    Let $\tau_{1}$ and $\tau_{2}$ be two topologies on a set $X$. Prove each of the following statements.
    \begin{enumerate}[label={(\roman*)}]
        \item If $\tau_{3}$ is defined by $\tau_{3} = \tau_{1}\cup \tau_{2}$, then $\tau_{3}$ is not necessarily a topology on $X$. (Justify your answer, by finding a concrete example.)
        \item If $\tau_{4}$ is defined by $\tau_{4} = \tau_{1}\cap \tau_{2}$, then $\tau_{4}$ is a topology on $X$. (The topology $\tau_{4}$ is said to be the {\color{red}intersection} of the topologies $\tau_{1}$ and $\tau_{2}$.)
        \item If $(X, \tau_{1})$ and $(X, \tau_{2})$ are $T_{1}$-spaces, then $(X, \tau_{4})$ is also a $T_{1}$-space.
        \item If $(X, \tau_{1})$ and $(X, \tau_{2})$ are $T_{0}$-spaces, then $(X, \tau_{4})$ is not necessarily a $T_{0}$-space. (Justify your answer by finding a concrete example.)
        \item If $\tau_{1}$, $\tau_{2}$, \ldots, $\tau_{n}$ are topologies on a set $X$, then $\tau = \bigcap^{n}_{i=1} \tau_{i}$ is a topology on $X$.
        \item If for each $i\in I$, for some index set $I$, each $T_{i}$ is a topology on the set $X$, then $\tau = \bigcap_{i\in I} \tau_{i}$ is a topology on $X$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}[label={(\roman*)}]
        \item For example, let $X = \{ 0, 1, 2 \}$, $\tau_{1} = \{ X, \varnothing, \{ 0 \} \}$, $\tau_{2} = \{ X, \varnothing, \{ 1 \} \}$ are two topologies on $X$.

              $\tau_{1}\cup\tau_{2} = \{ X, \varnothing, \{ 0 \}, \{ 1 \} \}$ is not a topology on $X$, since $\{ 0 \}\cup \{ 1 \} = \{ 0, 1 \}$ is not an open set.
        \item $\varnothing$ and $X$ are open sets in $(X, \tau_{1})$, $(X, \tau_{2})$ so they are members of $\tau_{1}\cap \tau_{2}$.

              If ${(A_{i})}_{i\in I}$ is a family of open sets in $(X, \tau_{1})$ and $(X, \tau_{2})$, then $\bigcup_{i\in I} A_{i}$ is an open set in $(X, \tau_{1})$ and $(X, \tau_{2})$. Therefore $\bigcup_{i\in I} A_{i}$ is a member of $\tau_{1}\cap\tau_{2}$.

              If $A$, $B$ are open sets in $(X, \tau_{1})$, $(X, \tau_{2})$, then $A\cap B$ is a member of $\tau_{1}\cap \tau_{2}$.

              Thus $\tau_{4} = \tau_{1}\cap\tau_{2}$ is a topology on $X$.
        \item Let $\{ x \}$ be a singleton subset of $X$. Since $(X, \tau_{1})$, $(X, \tau_{2})$ are $T_{1}$-spaces, then $\{ x \}$ is closed in $(X, \tau_{1})$, $(X, \tau_{2})$. Therefore, the complement of $\{ x \}$ is open in $(X, \tau_{1})$, $(X, \tau_{2})$, so the complement of $\{ x \}$ is open in $(X, \tau_{1}\cap \tau_{2})$. Hence $\{x \}$ is closed in $(X, \tau_{1}\cap\tau_{2})$.

              Thus $(X, \tau_{1}\cap\tau_{2})$ is also a $T_{1}$-space.
        \item For example, let $X = \{ 0, 1 \}$ and $\tau_{1} = \{ X, \varnothing, \{ 0 \} \}$, $\tau_{2} = \{ X, \varnothing, \{ 1 \} \}$ are two topologies on $X$. $(X, \tau_{1})$ and $(X, \tau_{2})$ are $T_{0}$-spaces (furthermore, Sierpinski spaces.)

              $(X, \tau_{1}\cap \tau_{2})$ is not a $T_{0}$-space, since in $(X, \tau_{1}\cap\tau_{2})$, there is no open set that contains $0$ but not $1$, there is no open set that contains $1$ but not $0$.
        \item For $n = 1$, $\tau_{1}$ is a topology on $X$. For $n = 2$, $\tau_{1}\cap\tau_{2}$ is a topology on $X$.

              Assume that for $n = k\geq 2$, $\bigcap^{k}_{i=1}\tau_{i}$ is a topology on $X$. According to the induction hypothesis and the definition of intersection of topologies, $\bigcap^{k+1}_{i=1}\tau_{i} = \left( \bigcap^{k}_{i=1} \tau_{i} \right) \cap \tau_{k+1}$ is a topology on $X$.

              Thus, due to the principle of mathematical induction, $\tau = \bigcap^{n}_{i=1}\tau_{i}$ is a topology on $X$, for every positive integer $n$.
        \item Since $\tau_{i}$ is a topology on $X$ for every $i\in I$, then $\varnothing$, $X$ are members of $\tau_{i}$.

              Suppose that each set in the family ${(A_{j})}_{j\in J}$ is a member of $\bigcap_{i\in I} \tau_{i}$. Then $\bigcup_{j\in J} A_{j}$ is a member of $\tau_{i}$ for every $i\in I$. Therefore, $\bigcup_{j\in J} A_{j}$ is a member of $\bigcap_{i\in I} \tau_{i}$.

              Suppose that $A$, $B$ are members of $\bigcap_{i\in I} \tau_{i}$. Then $A$, $B$ are members of $\tau_{i}$ for every $i\in I$, then $A\cap B$ is a member of $\tau_{i}$ for every $i\in I$. So $A\cap B$ is a member of $\bigcap_{i\in I} \tau_{i}$.

              Thus, $\tau = \bigcap_{i\in I}\tau_{i}$ is a topology on $X$.

\begin{exercise}
    In Wikipedia, \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_topological_space}, as we noted in Exercises 1.2 \#7, it says that the number of topologies on a finite set with
    $n\in \mathbb{N}$ points can be quite large, even for small $n$. This is also true even for $T_{0}$-spaces as defined in Exercises 1.3 \#5. Indeed that same Wikipedia source says, that if $n = 3$, there are 19 distinct $T_{0}$-spaces; for $n = 4$, there are 219 distinct $T_{0}$-spaces; for $n = 5$, there are 4231 distinct $T_{0}$-spaces. Prove, using mathematical induction, that as $n$ increases, the number of $T_{0}$-spaces increases.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    When $n = 1$, there is 1 $T_{0}$-space.

    Assume that there are $M$ $T_{0}$-spaces with $n$ points. Let's consider the set $S = \{ a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}, a_{n+1} \}$. Let $\tau$ be a topology on $S\setminus\{ a_{n+1} \}$ such that $(S\setminus\{ a_{n+1} \}, \tau)$ is a $T_{0}$-space, then $(S, \tau\cup\{ S, \{ a_{n+1} \} \})$ is a $T_{0}$-space, so there are at least $M$ $T_{0}$-spaces with $(n+1)$ points. On the other hand, every discrete space is a $T_{0}$-space, so there are at least $M+1$ $T_{0}$-spaces with $(n+1)$ points.

    Thus, as $n$ increases, the number of $T_{0}$-spaces increases.

        \item No.

    A subset $S$ of a topological space $(X, \tau)$ is said to be {\color{red}saturated} if it is an intersection of open sets in $(X, \tau)$.
    \begin{enumerate}[label={(\roman*)}]
        \item Verify that every open set is a saturated set.
        \item Verify that in a $T_{1}$-space, every set is a saturated set.
        \item Give an example of a topological space which has at least one subset which is not saturated.
        \item Is it true that if the topological space $(X, \tau)$ is such that every subset is saturated, then $(X, \tau)$ is a $T_{1}$-space?
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    \begin{enumerate}[label={(\roman*)}]
        \item Let $S$ be an open set in $(X, \tau)$, then $S = S\cap S$. So $S$ is a saturated set.
        \item Let $S$ be a set in the $T_{1}$-space $(X, \tau)$.

              Let $x$ be an element of $X\setminus S$. Since $(X, \tau)$ is a $T_{1}$-space, then $\{ x \}$ is closed. Therefore $X\setminus S$ is a union of closed sets. So due to the De Morgan's formula, $S$ is an intersection of open set.

              Hence every set in a $T_{1}$-space is a saturated set.
        \item $X = \{ 0, 1 \}$, $\tau = \{ X, \varnothing, \{ 0 \} \}$. $(X, \tau)$ is a Sierpinski space. $\{ 1 \}$ is not a saturated set in $(X, \tau)$.
        \item Yes.

              If every set in the topological space $(X, \tau)$ is saturated, then complement of every singleton subset is saturated. So the complement of every singleton subset is an intersection of open sets. So every singleton set is a union of closed sets, which means every singleton set is closed. Thus $(X, \tau)$ is a $T_{1}$-space.
    \end{enumerate}

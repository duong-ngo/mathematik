\chapter*{Conventions}

In this note, I aim to provide a comprehensive and constructive approach to mathematical analysis, which means I will not leave any proofs as exercises to readers and I will restrict the use of proof by contradiction to prove the existence of an object. However, this approach would be really verbose, and it can even be tedious because of my dry writing style. I don't want my writing to be tedious. Instead of listing theorems to theorems and proofs to proofs, I will add an abstract to (almost) every subsection to recap the content of the subsection, explain my solution along the way. In every subsection, the main results will be emphasized. On the other hand, there are main theorems which require some intermediate results (let's call them lemmas). I will write them sequentially (lemmas and then proofs), but the lemmas (I might mark them as theorems) will have an italic heading. For example

\noindent\textit{\textbf{Theorem 1.}} This is an intermediate theorem.

\noindent\textbf{Theorem 2.} This is a main theorem.

Readers can safely jump right in the main results and then revisit the intermediate results when ever needed.
